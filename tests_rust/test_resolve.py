"""First-cut stack resolution on the Rust ``GameState``.

Composes round-5 stack (``push/pop/peek``) + round-3 bridge effects
(``Effect::DealDamage``) + round-3 damage (``deal_damage``) +
zone-search to actually resolve a stack item end-to-end.

Ported from the spell-resolution path in
``src/mtg_bot/actions.py:resolve_top_of_stack``. The Python side
spreads resolution across hundreds of lines (counters, abilities,
auras, modal modes, X / kicker, replacement effects); the Rust
first slice carves off the irreducible primitive: pop one item,
look up the source's printing's effects, dispatch each one.

**Scope simplifications** (mirrored in the module docstring on
``rust/src/state_ops_resolve.rs``):

- **Supported effects: just ``DealDamage``.** The other effect
  variants don't exist in the bridge yet — the round-3 bridge slice
  only landed ``DealDamage``. Any unknown variant raises
  ``ValueError`` loudly rather than silently no-op'ing.
- **Targeting is deterministic + simplified.**
  ``TargetFilter::AnyPlayer`` resolves to the defending player
  (``1 - active_player``); ``TargetFilter::AnyCreature`` resolves
  to the FIRST creature on the defending player's battlefield
  (smallest index in their ``battlefield`` Vec). If there is no
  creature on the defender's side, the spell fizzles — stack item
  still pops, but no damage is applied.
- **No spell-source movement after resolve.** Real MTG: an
  instant/sorcery on the stack goes to graveyard after resolution;
  a permanent spell goes to battlefield. For first slice, just pop
  the stack item — caller is responsible for movement. Documented
  as a stepping-stone.
- **No stack-empty error.** ``resolve_top_of_stack()`` on an empty
  stack returns None gracefully.

## Test-setup helper

Constructing a state where a specific obj_id resolves to a
specific printing's effects is awkward — the registry is private to
the GameState and the synthetic-state seed has no DealDamage
printings. We add a single test-fixture method on the resolve slice:
``register_and_inject_object(printing_dict, controller, zone) ->
new_obj_id``. It (a) parses + appends the printing into the
in-place registry via ``Arc::make_mut`` and (b) constructs a fresh
GameObject pointing at it on the requested zone. Lives in the
resolve slice (not state.rs) per per-slice file-isolation.
