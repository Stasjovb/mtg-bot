"""Rules-restricting statics for the Vintage Roto P1 package (stack &
restrictions), modeled on :mod:`mtg_bot.creature_statics_wg`.

The parser (``cards.parser.roto_stack``) puts static descriptors on
``CardPrinting.roto_statics``; this module reads them off permanents on
the battlefield and off command-zone emblems (the "this turn" player
restrictions a resolved spell leaves behind, which expire at cleanup):

* :class:`SpellTax` -- "<Spells> cost {N} more to cast" with the riders
  the existing ``spell_cost_increases`` field can't express: "except
  during its controller's turn" (Defense Grid), "with the chosen name"
  (Disruptor Flute). Added by ``creature_statics_wg.
  spell_cost_increase`` (CR 601.2f increases).
* :class:`MinimumSpellCost` -- "As long as this artifact is untapped,
  each spell that would cost less than three mana to cast costs three
  mana to cast." (Trinisphere), applied after every other cost change
  (:func:`apply_minimum_spell_cost`).
* :class:`CastProhibition` -- can't-cast statics: the chosen name
  (Meddling Mage), player-scoped "this turn" restrictions (Silence,
  Orim's Chant, Ranger-Captain of Eos).
* :class:`ActivationProhibition` -- "Activated abilities of sources with
  the chosen name can't be activated [unless they're mana abilities]."
  (Pithing Needle, Phyrexian Revoker, Disruptor Flute).

``legal.legal_actions`` drops the forbidden ``CastSpell`` /
``ActivateAbility`` proposals through :func:`filter_actions`.
