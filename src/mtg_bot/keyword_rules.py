"""Rules consumers for the evasion / protection keyword family.

Hexproof (CR 702.11), shroud (CR 702.18) and protection (CR 702.16)
all restrict what may *target* a permanent; protection additionally
restricts damage, blocking and attachment (the "DEBT" mnemonic:
Damage is prevented, it can't be Enchanted / Equipped by, Blocked by,
or Targeted by sources with the stated quality).

The keywords themselves live in ``effective_keywords`` like every other
keyword, so printed, anthem-granted, Equipment-granted and
until-end-of-turn grants all reach these helpers through one walk.
Protection is spelled ``"protection from <quality>"`` in the keyword
set (``"protection from red"``, ``"protection from creatures"``,
``"protection from everything"``, ...); the printing-level
``protection_from_color`` field (layer-3 color-word rewritable, see
``effective_protection_from_colors``) is folded in as well.

The engine's target enumerators (``Effect.legal_targets`` overrides)
are per-effect, so the targeting restriction is applied at the
chokepoints that turn an enumerated pool into a choice: spell casting,
ability activation, triggered-ability stacking, and the legality
checks in ``legal.py``. Resolution re-checks the same rule via
:func:`targets_all_illegal_on_resolution` (CR 608.2b).
