"""Canonical rules-engine interface.

Two entry points cover everything a caller (test, agent, or UI) needs:

- ``legal_moves(state, player_id=None)`` — enumerate the legal priority-level
  actions available to ``player_id`` (defaulting to whoever has priority right
  now). Priority-level means pass-priority, play-land, and cast-spell actions.
- ``apply(state, action, player_id=None)`` — transform ``state`` by applying
  ``action``. Mutates in place; returns the same state so callers can chain.
  Handles every ``Action`` subclass, including the combat-declaration actions
  (``DeclareAttackers``, ``DeclareBlockers``) that aren't enumerable as legal
  moves because their decision space is combinatorial.

For combat declarations, construct the action directly with whichever
attacker/blocker ids you want, then apply it — ``apply`` silently filters out
ineligible ids (summoning-sick attackers, blockers that can't block a flier,
etc.). The helpers ``mtg_bot.combat.eligible_attackers`` /
``mtg_bot.combat.eligible_blockers`` are useful for telling you *which* ids are
valid in the current state.
