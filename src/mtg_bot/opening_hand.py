"""Opening-hand actions (CR 103.6): cards that let a player begin the
game with them on the battlefield.

After every player has kept their opening hand (and bottomed their
mulligan cards), starting with the starting player and proceeding in
turn order, each player may take the actions their opening-hand cards
allow (CR 103.6, 103.6a). The printed shape is::

    If this card is in your opening hand[ and you're not the starting
    player], you may begin the game with <it | this card's name> on the
    battlefield[ with a <kind> counter on it].[ If you do, exile <N>
    card(s) from your hand.]

(Gemstone Caverns; the Leylines' shorter form is the same shape with no
optional parts.) The parser builds a :class:`BeginGameOnBattlefield` into
``CardPrinting.opening_hand_action``; ``simulate.setup_game`` calls
:func:`apply_opening_hand_actions` once, after the final keep.

Two more pregame actions share the field (roto package P6):

* :class:`RevealFromOpeningHand` -- "You may reveal this card from your
  opening hand. If you do, at the beginning of your first main phase of
  the game, <effect>." (Chancellor of the Tangle). Also a CR 103.6
  opening-hand action: revealing it schedules a delayed triggered ability
  (a ``state.delayed_triggers`` ``"step": "main"`` entry, fired by
  ``turn.run_delayed_main_phase_triggers`` at the player's next main
  phase -- their first of the game, since nothing precedes it).
* :class:`ExchangeHandWhileMulliganing` -- "Any time you could mulligan
  and this card is in your hand, you may exile all the cards from your
  hand, then draw that many cards." (Serum Powder). Not an opening-hand
  action: it is offered in every mulligan window, before the player's
  keep-or-mulligan decision (:func:`apply_mulligan_window_actions`,
  called from ``simulate.setup_game``'s mulligan loop). Using it is not a
  mulligan -- no extra card goes to the bottom on keep.

The "you may" is the player's decision, asked through the generic
``Agent.choose_yes_no`` hook; the card exiled for the "If you do" rider
is picked through ``Agent.choose_discard`` (the hook every "exile a card
from your hand" cost uses). Both are pre-game decisions made by the
seat's setup agent -- search never sees them (``docs/SEARCH_LIMITATIONS.md``).
