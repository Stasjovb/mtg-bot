    """Centralized predicate-trigger dispatcher.

    Walks every battlefield permanent and fires any predicate-style
    triggered ability whose ``event`` matches ``event`` and whose
    ``predicate`` evaluates true against ``subjects`` and the source.
    String-key (legacy) abilities are NOT fired here — they continue
    flowing through the per-event ``_fire_*`` paths until migration
    is complete. Both styles coexist; ``__post_init__`` on
    ``TriggeredAbility`` enforces that no single ability sets both.

    ``label`` is the human-readable string attached to the resulting
    stack item (defaults to the event's value, e.g. ``"enters"``).
    ``subjects`` is the named subject mapping for the event — see
    ``EVENT_SUBJECTS`` in ``effects/predicates.py``.

    ``extra_observers`` is an additional list of ``GameObject`` whose
    triggered abilities should be checked alongside the battlefield.
    Used by DIES / LEAVES_BATTLEFIELD dispatch to include the dearly-
    departed (already moved off the battlefield by the caller) as a
    candidate observer for its own self-triggers (``IsSelf()`` against
    the dying object). Permanents on the battlefield that ALSO appear
    in ``extra_observers`` are not double-counted.

    ``combat_damage_amount`` threads the damage amount through to each
    pushed StackItem so resolving effects can read
    ``state.resolving_combat_damage_amount``. Used by the DEALT_DAMAGE
    dispatch (Pain for All's echo, Cryoshatter's destroy-on-damage,
    etc.); zero for events that don't carry damage. ``counter_amount``
    is the analogous channel for the COUNTERS_ADDED event
    (Terrasymbiosis's "draw that many cards" rider). ``fixed_targets``
    forwards a pre-determined target tuple to every pushed StackItem
    (used by DISCARDS_CARD to expose the discarding player as
    ``("player", id)`` so Entropic Battlecruiser's "they lose 3 life"
    half can damage them without needing target selection).

    For ``Event.ENTERS`` the per-source firings are multiplied by
    ``etb_trigger_multiplier`` (Starfield Vocalist's "triggers an
    additional time" replacement). The legacy ``_fire_*`` paths apply
    the same multiplier — keeping the dispatcher consistent means a
    landfall trigger migrated to the predicate path keeps doubling
    under Starfield, the same way the ``etb`` self-trigger path does
    in ``_trigger_etb_abilities``.
