"""Conspiracy cards (CR 313) in the command zone -- roto package P6.

A conspiracy is never a permanent and is never cast: it starts the game
face up in the command zone and stays there (CR 313.2), and its static
abilities function from there. In a Conspiracy Draft game each player
may put conspiracy cards from their card pool into the command zone
before the game begins (CR 905). The engine's decklist is that card pool
as brought to the game, so a conspiracy named in a decklist is one the
player puts into the command zone: :func:`begin_game_with_conspiracies`
(called once by ``simulate.setup_game`` right after the libraries are
built, before the starting player is used, the libraries are shuffled
or any opening hand is drawn) moves it out of the library onto
``Player.conspiracies`` and applies the pregame rules the conspiracies
carry (``CardPrinting.conspiracy_rules``):

* :class:`YouAreTheStartingPlayer` -- Power Play: "You are the starting
  player. If multiple players would be the starting player, one of those
  players is chosen at random." Overrides the caller's starting seat
  (``setup_game(starting_player_idx=...)``, the coin flip of CR 103.1);
  several claimants are resolved with the setup RNG, which is consumed
  only in that case so every other game's shuffles are unchanged.
* :class:`MinimumDeckSizeChange` -- Advantageous Proclamation: "Your
  minimum deck size is reduced by five." Moves the player's minimum
  deck size (CR 100.2a: 40 in limited play). The engine checks deck size
  only when the caller passes ``setup_game(minimum_deck_size=...)`` --
  then a deck below its owner's adjusted minimum is rejected loudly.
  Conspiracy cards aren't part of the deck, so they don't count toward
  it.
* :class:`OpponentRevealsHandAfterMulligans` -- Meddling Wizard (a custom
  conspiracy of the Vintage Roto group, record hand-authored in
  ``data/cube_roto_custom.json``): "At the beginning of each game, after
  mulligans, your opponent reveals their hand to you." Applied by
  :func:`reveal_hands_after_mulligans`, ``simulate.setup_game``'s second
  conspiracy hook, once every player has kept and bottomed.

Conspiracies with other abilities (hidden agenda, draft-matters text)
have no rule class here; the parser leaves them unclaimed.
