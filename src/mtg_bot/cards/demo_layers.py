"""Real Magic cards from outside the EoE pool, used to exercise
layered-effects machinery (CR 613) that no current EoE card stresses.

Not registered in ``NONLAND_POOL`` / ``all_printings`` — these aren't
draftable, deckable, or castable through the normal card pool. Tests
import the printings directly to construct GameObjects.

Currently:

- ``LIGNIFY`` (Lorwyn) — "Enchant creature. Enchanted creature is a
  Treefolk creature with base power and toughness 0/4 and has no
  abilities." Combines layer 4 (add subtype "Treefolk"), layer 6
  (lose all abilities), and layer 7 sublayer 1 (set base P/T 0/4).
- ``CLONE`` (Alpha) — "You may have Clone enter as a copy of any
  creature on the battlefield." Layer 1 copy effect: at ETB the
  controller picks a target creature, and the clone takes that
  creature's PRINTED characteristics (CR 706.2 copiable values —
  not auras, counters, or current animations). Writes a layer-1
  ``"is_copy"`` registry entry so the layered system records the
  copy event; the entry is dropped when the clone leaves play.
- ``CYTOSHAPE`` (Saviors of Kamigawa, simplified) — "Until end
  of turn, target creature becomes a copy of another target
  creature." Sorcery, layer-1 copy effect with
  ``expires_at="cleanup"``. The cleanup-time printing revert is
  wired via ``revert_printing_if_no_layer1_copies`` called from
  ``run_cleanup_step`` after expiring registry entries.
- ``MAGICAL_HACK`` (Alpha) — "Change the text of target spell or
  permanent by replacing all instances of one basic land type with
  another." Sorcery, layer 3 text-changing. The demo targets a
  basic land and rewrites its basic-land-type subtype, which flows
  through ``effective_subtypes`` and ``effective_land_produces`` so
  the rewritten land taps for the new color. Persistent (no
  ``expires_at``) — text changes survive cleanup per CR 612.
- ``SLEIGHT_OF_MIND`` (Alpha) — "Change the text of target spell
  or permanent by replacing all instances of one color word with
  another." Sorcery, layer 3 text-changing. The demo rewrites
  ``protection_from_color`` on the target — pair with White
  Knight to flip its protection from black to a different color.
  Same persistent semantics as Magical Hack.
- ``WHITE_KNIGHT`` (Alpha) — 2/2 white Knight with first strike and
  protection from black. Used as the protection-target so layer 5
  color changes have observable consequences in combat.
- ``SCUTTLEMUTT`` (Shards of Alara) — 3/3 Scarecrow with
  ``{T}: Target creature becomes the color or colors of your choice
  until end of turn.`` Layer 5 color-changing effect that writes a
  ``"set_colors"`` registry entry with ``expires_at="cleanup"``.
- ``DRYAD_OF_THE_ILYSIAN_GROVE`` (Theros Beyond Death) — 1/5 Dryad
  with "Lands you control are every basic land type in addition
  to their other types." Layer 4 add_subtype contribution
  synthesized in ``effective_subtypes`` so it interacts correctly
  by timestamp with Magus of the Moon / Blood Moon's "set basic
  land subtype to Mountain" layer-4 effect. Magus of the Moon
  already lives in the EoE Special Guests pool, so the famous
  Dryad-vs-Blood-Moon timestamp interaction can be tested by
  pairing this Dryad with the existing Magus printing.
- ``BLOOD_MOON`` (The Dark) — Enchantment "Nonbasic lands are
  Mountains." Same layer-4 set_basic_land_subtype mechanism as
  Magus of the Moon but printed as an enchantment.
- ``PAINTERS_SERVANT`` (Shadowmoor) — Artifact "As Painter's
  Servant enters, choose a color. All cards that aren't on the
  battlefield, spells, and permanents are the chosen color in
  addition to their other colors." Wires via the
  ``paints_all_objects_chosen_color_at_etb`` printing flag and
  the per-instance ``GameObject.painter_chosen_color`` set at
  ETB. ``effective_colors`` synthesizes a layer-5 ``add_colors``
  entry from each Painter source.
- ``HUMILITY`` (Tempest) — Enchantment "All creatures lose all
  abilities and have base power and toughness 1/1." The canonical
  reference card for the layer system. Wires via the
  ``wipes_all_creature_abilities`` (layer 6) and
  ``sets_all_creature_pt_to_1_1`` (layer 7b) printing flags;
  ``_layer6_entries_for`` and ``_registry_set_base_pt`` synthesize
  per-creature entries from each Humility source.
- ``URBORG_TOMB_OF_YAWGMOTH`` (Planar Chaos) — Legendary Land
  with printed Swamp subtype and "Each land is a Swamp in
  addition to its other types." The famous test case for the
  CR 613.7 within-layer dependency rule: Blood Moon + Urborg
  always resolves to Mountain regardless of timestamps because
  Urborg's ability depends on Blood Moon's effect (Blood Moon
  rewrites Urborg's basic land type, which wipes Urborg's static
  via CR 305.6).
