"""Per-line diagnosis of why the oracle parser leaves a card unclaimed.

The parser claims a card only when every oracle line parses, and on
failure it says nothing about *which* line failed. This module answers
that by probing the same builder chain with edited copies of the card's
raw Scryfall record:

1. **Units.** Each face's oracle text splits into lines; a modal bullet
   (``•``) travels with the line that introduces it (``Choose one --``),
   so a mode list is probed as one unit. Pure-reminder lines are dropped
   (the parser strips reminder text anyway).
2. **Isolation.** Build a copy whose only rules text is one unit (every
   other line on every face blanked). A unit that builds alone passes.
3. **Add-back.** A unit that fails alone may be a rider that only parses
   next to its effect ("As an additional cost to cast this spell, ...",
   "Activate only as a sorcery."). It is retried together with every
   passing unit; if that builds, it passes in context. When the card's
   own lines can't serve as that companion, an optional caller-supplied
   *witness* line known to parse on the type (``"Draw a card."``) does,
   provided the witness builds on that very card.
4. **Confirm.** Build the card from the passing units only.

   - ``kind == "lines"`` (``confirmed``): some units fail, and the card
     builds without them (next to the witness when no own unit passes):
     the failing units are the whole blocker.
   - ``kind == "unconfirmed"``: no unit passes and no usable witness
     exists (multi-face layouts, unsupported card types), so the frame
     itself couldn't be checked -- it may block too.
   - ``kind == "mixed"``: some units fail *and* the passing units don't
     build together -- a cross-line or structural blocker on top.
   - ``kind == "structure"``: every unit parses, yet the card doesn't
     build -- the layout, type line, mana cost or the combination of
     lines isn't modeled.

A probe is a diagnosis aid for planning grammar work, never a claim:
nothing here feeds the parser or the card source.
