"""Card printings, mana cost parsing, basic lands, and the Stage-1 synthetic pool.

Public API: everything below remains importable from ``mtg_bot.cards`` for
back-compat. Internal layout (submodules):

- ``base``           — CardPrinting + ManaCost + all ``make_*`` helpers +
                       pre-built granted-ability constants.
- ``lands``          — Basic lands, Planet lands, Utility lands, Shock lands.
- ``synthetic``      — Stage-1 invented vanilla creatures.
- ``tokens``         — Token printings created by effects (Lander, Robot,
                       Drone, Sliver, Munitions).
- ``parser``         — Oracle-text parser sub-package (the production
                       card source). Pulls printings from
                       ``data/edge_of_eternities.json`` and friends.
- ``source``         — ``CardSource`` protocol + ``get_active_source`` /
                       ``set_active_source`` seam.
