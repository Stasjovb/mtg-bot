"""Instant / sorcery ``CardPrinting`` builder.

Single-line spells are parsed straight via the unified spell-effect
phrase parser. Multi-line spells split on ``\\n`` into clauses and
combine them via one of three combinators — ``ConditionalIfVoid`` for
the Plasma-Bolt-shaped Void rider, ``ModalChooseOne`` for Scryfall's
``Choose one —`` modal shape, otherwise ``Sequence`` if every
clause parses as a plain spell-effect sentence. Any unparseable
clause skips the whole spell.

A leading clause that is just an unimplemented spell-only keyword
plus its parenthesized reminder text (currently only ``Convoke``)
is dropped before the remaining clauses are parsed — the static
side ships these spells without modeling the keyword, so the
parser must do the same to stay in parity. See
``_SPELL_KEYWORD_PREAMBLE_RE`` for the exact recognized shapes.

Cost-reduction rider clauses (``This spell costs {N} less to cast
if <condition>.``) are likewise stripped from the effect-clause
stream and surfaced separately on the ``CardPrinting`` via the
``cost_reductions`` kwarg. The ``_detect_cost_reductions`` helper
scans the original text for those rules; ``_parse_spell_oracle_
text`` drops the matching clauses before combinator dispatch.

The modal branch handles two Scryfall printed header shapes:
``Choose one —`` (single-mode pick) and ``Choose one or both —``
(controller may resolve either mode alone or both). Each is followed
by two or more mode lines that begin with ``• `` (bullet + space)
and contain a single sentence parseable by the unified spell-effect
grammar. The ``Choose one or both`` shape constructs
``ModalChooseOne(or_both=True)`` so the engine routes mode-pick
through the agent's ``choose_modes`` (plural) hook. ``Choose two``,
multi-line modes, and ``up to two target`` mode-counts remain out of
scope; the parser declines those spells until the engine grows the
matching machinery.

#      CostReduction rule is attached to the printing.  (Drag to the
#      Roots.)
#
#   3. **Modal-header upgrade** — ``Delirium — Choose one. If there
#      are four or more card types among cards in your graveyard, choose
#      one or more instead.``  The header is replaced by the bare
#      ``Choose one —`` semantics; the mode lines that follow still

# Unimplemented secondary-rider regexes — recognizers for clauses that
# the parser drops because the engine lacks the plumbing to model them.
# Unlike the Delirium multi-clause dropper (which strips an entire line

# match the SECOND sentence of a two-clause spell body.  When the
# FIRST sentence parses cleanly as a standalone effect and the second
# matches one of these patterns, the two-clause path returns just the
# first-sentence effect (same simplification the bespoke entries make).
#
# Five shapes exist in the EoE/DSK pool:
#
#   1. **Controller-manifest rider** — ``Its controller manifests
#      dread.``  (entry: "Destroy target creature. Its controller
#      manifests dread." → DestroyTargetCreature()).  The engine's
#      ManifestDread primitive resolves for the *casting* controller;
#      adding a ``for_controller_of_target=True`` path would require
#      non-trivial wiring through the targeting/resolution pipeline.
#
#   2. **Death-trigger manifest rider** — ``When it dies this turn,
#      manifest dread.``  (entry: "Target creature gets +3/+0 until
#      end of turn. When it dies this turn, manifest dread." →
#      PumpTargetCreatureUntilEOT(3, 0)).  The engine has no UEOT-
#      scoped per-target death-trigger registry; adding one for a
#      single card's rider would be a non-trivial widening.
#
#   3. **Optional-graveyard-return rider** — ``You may return a
#      permanent card from your graveyard to your hand.``  (entry:
#      "Manifest dread.\n You may return a permanent card from your
#      graveyard to your hand." → ManifestDread()).  Every existing
#      ``Return*FromGraveyardToHand`` primitive is creature-typed;
#      widening to "any permanent card" with optionality for a single
#      card's rider is a non-trivial engine change.
#
#   4. **Mana-spent conditional draw** — ``If the amount of mana spent
#      to cast that spell was less than its mana value, you draw a
#      card.``  (entry: Unravel, "Counter target spell. If the
#      amount…" → CounterTargetSpell()).  The engine doesn't track
#      per-spell cast-time mana accounting.
#
#   5. **Subtype-filtered UEOT keyword grant** — ``<Subtype>s you
#      control gain <keywords> until end of turn.``  (entry: Midnight
#      Mayhem, "Create three 1/1 red Gremlin creature tokens. Gremlins
#      you control gain menace, lifelink, and haste until end of
#      turn." → CreateToken(Gremlin, count=3)).  The existing
#      ``PumpCreaturesYouControlUntilEOT`` applies to ALL your
#      creatures; a subtype-filtered variant would need a new optional
#      kwarg or a sibling primitive for one card's rider.
#
#   6. **Exile-on-death rider** — ``If that creature or planeswalker
#      would die this turn, exile it instead.``  (entry: Scorching
#      Dragonfire, "Scorching Dragonfire deals 3 damage to target
#      creature or planeswalker. If that creature or planeswalker

#      UEOT-scoped "exile-instead-of-die" replacement-effect registry
#      for targeted permanents; adding one for a single card's rider
#      is a non-trivial engine widening.
#
#   7. **"If they do" pay-or-counter consequent** — ``If they do,
#      <effect>.``  (entries: Divert Disaster, Don't Make a Sound).
#      The ``Unless its controller pays {N}`` escape clause in the
#      first sentence is recognized as ``CounterTargetSpell()`` via
#      the new ``_COUNTER_TARGET_SPELL_UNLESS_PAYS`` recognizer; the
#      resulting second clause ``If they do, you create a Lander
#      token.`` / ``If they do, surveil 2.`` has no standalone
#      primitive because the engine doesn't model the pay-cost-or-
#      counter branching that determines whether "they do" applies.
#
#   8. **Conditional reanimate-this-way rider** — ``If a creature
#      card is put into a graveyard this way, return it to the
#      battlefield under your control.``  (entry: Come Back Wrong).
#      The engine has no "if destroyed-this-way creature card was
#      put into graveyard, reanimate it" conditional reanimate
#      primitive; adding one would require wiring back to the
#      resolution context of the triggering Destroy effect.
#
#   9. **Delayed end-step sacrifice trigger** — ``Sacrifice it at
#      the beginning of your next end step.``  (entry: Come Back
#      Wrong).  The engine has no per-object one-shot delayed
#      end-step sacrifice trigger registry.

    """Parse a spell's full oracle text into a single ``Effect``.

    Single-line: parsed by ``_parse_spell_effect_phrase`` directly.
    Multi-line: each ``\\n``-separated clause is parsed; clauses are
    combined either via ``ConditionalIfVoid`` (when the second clause
    is a Void replacement of the first damage effect), via
    ``ModalChooseOne`` (Scryfall ``Choose one —`` or
    ``Choose one or both —`` shape), or via ``Sequence`` (every clause
    is a plain spell-effect sentence).
    Leading clauses that are unimplemented spell-keyword preambles
    (e.g. Vote Out's Convoke) are dropped before combinator dispatch
    so they don't fail the per-clause parse. ``This spell costs {N}
    less to cast if <condition>.`` cost-reduction riders are likewise
    dropped here — the rule is captured separately by
    ``_detect_cost_reductions`` and threaded onto the resulting
    ``CardPrinting`` via the ``cost_reductions`` kwarg.

    A single oracle-text line that packs two effect sentences
    separated by ``. `` (Radiant Strike's
    ``"Destroy target artifact or tapped creature. You gain 3 life."``,
    Sami's Curiosity's ``"You gain 2 life. Create a Lander token."``)
    is further carved at the sentence boundary by ``_split_sentences``
    after reminder-text stripping and cost-reduction dropping. Each
    resulting sentence is then a clause in its own right — the
    Sequence combinator path picks them up the same way it would for
    a printing that put each sentence on its own ``\\n``-separated

    ``StaticAbility`` carrying a ``ReplacementEffect(WOULD_GO_TO_
    GRAVEYARD, Replace(new_destination="library"))`` if ``text``
    contains a recognized self-shuffle rider for ``name``; an empty
    tuple otherwise.

    Two shapes are recognized:
      - ``Shuffle <Name> into its owner's library.`` (Green Sun's
        Zenith). Appears as the trailing sentence of the spell's
        single oracle line.
      - ``If <Name> would be put into a graveyard from anywhere,
        reveal <Name> and shuffle it into its owner's library
        instead.`` (Nexus of Fate). Appears as the spell's second
        oracle line.

    The matcher uses ``re.search`` (not ``re.match``) so it finds the
    rider regardless of where in the spell text it appears. Each
    pattern interpolates ``re.escape(name)`` so a card name with regex
    metacharacters (e.g. apostrophes, periods) doesn't break the
    match. Non-matching texts return an empty tuple.

    The returned ``StaticAbility`` rides on the spell printing's
    ``static_abilities`` tuple. The dispatcher's moving-card walker
    in :func:`mtg_bot.effects.modifiers._collect_replacement_effects`
    visits ``card.printing.static_abilities`` for events that pass a
    ``"card"`` subject (today: ``WOULD_GO_TO_GRAVEYARD`` from
    ``actions._send_to_graveyard_or_library``); the implicit
    ``card.owner_id == affected_player_id`` gate keys the replacement
    on the spell's owner.
