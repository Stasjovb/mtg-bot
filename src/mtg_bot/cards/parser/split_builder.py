"""Split card builder (CR 709) -- cube layouts bucket.

A split card (Life // Death) is one card with two halves, each an
instant or sorcery with its own name, mana cost and effect. Each half is
built on its own through the regular spell builder (a half is a card
record with ``layout == "normal"``). The card's printing carries the
combined characteristics it has in every zone but the stack (CR 709.4:
both names, the combined mana cost -- so its mana value is the total --
and both halves' types) with no effect of its own, and the halves in
``split_faces``; it is always cast as one half
(``CastSpell(cast_face=<half>)``, ``mtg_bot.layouts``).

Duskmourn Rooms share Scryfall's ``split`` layout but are permanents
with doors; they stay with ``room_builder`` (a split card here must have
two instant / sorcery halves).
