"""Enchantment card builders for Edge of Eternities + Duskmourn.

Every claim flows through one of two oracle-text grammar paths — there
are no remaining name-keyed bespoke factories:
- ``_build_aura_via_oracle_text`` for Enchantment — Aura cards
  (gated by ``_UNIFIED_AURA_NAMES``).
- ``_build_enchantment_via_oracle_text`` for non-Aura enchantments
  (gated by ``_UNIFIED_ENCHANTMENT_NAMES``).

The historical ``_ENCHANTMENT_BUILDERS`` dispatch table and its 21
``_build_*`` factory functions were retired on 2026-05-01 — every
card those factories used to claim now claims through the unified
oracle-text path or via Scryfall set-code-keyed dispatch elsewhere.
