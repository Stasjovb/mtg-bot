"""Creature ``CardPrinting`` builder.

Walks each line of the oracle text in order. Pre-clause checks
(Warp, Ward, Devour, cost-reduction rider, sorcery-speed rider)
consume the line directly; everything else goes through
``_parse_clause`` which dispatches to per-clause-type parsers. Any
unrecognized line skips the whole card (returns ``None``).
