"""Counterspell phrase recognizer built on the spell noun-phrase grammar
(:func:`mtg_bot.cards.parser.target_phrases.parse_spell_phrase`).

Shape (normalized phrase, dispatched by
:mod:`mtg_bot.cards.parser.precise_grammar`)::

    counter target <spell np>[ unless its controller pays {N}][ if it's <color>]
    [. If that spell is countered this way, <destination> instead ...]

Destinations: ``exile it instead of putting it into its owner's
graveyard`` (Force of Negation, No More Lies), ``put it on top of its
owner's library instead of into that player's graveyard`` (Memory
Lapse), ``put it into its owner's hand instead of into that player's
graveyard`` (Remand). All map onto :class:`CounterSpell`.
