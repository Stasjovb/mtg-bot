"""Activated-ability grammar.

An activated-ability line of the form ``{cost}: <effect>.`` where
``cost`` is one of:

  * One or more brace-wrapped mana symbols (``{1}{R}``, ``{2}``, …) —
    pure mana cost.
  * ``{T}`` — pure tap cost (no mana).
  * ``{T}, {mana}`` — tap plus a mana cost. The two pieces are
    comma-separated.
  * ``Sacrifice this creature`` / ``Sacrifice this artifact`` —
    pure sacrifice-self cost (the engine field ``sacrifice_self``
    covers both wordings; the only difference is which oracle phrase
    Scryfall uses depending on the source's card type).
  * ``{T}, Sacrifice this creature`` (or reversed) — tap plus
    sacrifice-self.
  * ``{mana}, Sacrifice this creature`` (or reversed) — mana plus
    sacrifice-self.
  * ``Pay N life`` — pure pay-life cost. Mana Confluence-style.
  * ``{T}, Pay N life`` (or reversed) — tap plus pay-life.
  * ``{mana}, Pay N life`` (or reversed) — mana plus pay-life.
  * ``Sacrifice another creature or artifact`` — pure
    sacrifice-another-creature-or-artifact cost. Matches Umbral
    Collar Zealot's ``Sacrifice another creature or artifact:
    Surveil 1.`` activated ability.
  * ``Remove a +1/+1 counter from a creature you control`` — pure
    counter-removal cost (Sunstar Chaplain pays this with mana
    today; the standalone form is accepted for symmetry with the
    other atoms). Maps to
    ``ActivationCost.remove_plus_one_counter_from_your_creature``.
  * Three-piece comma-separated combinations, order-insensitive.
    Each piece must classify as one of the recognized atoms (mana,
    tap, sacrifice-self, sacrifice-another-creature-or-artifact,
    sacrifice-another-artifact-or-land, sacrifice-a-food,
    sacrifice-a-land, pay-life, remove-+1/+1-counter). At most one
    mana piece, one tap, one sacrifice-flavor, one pay-life, and one
    counter-removal — anything else (duplicates, unknown atoms,
    4+ pieces) returns ``None``.
    Naturally observed three-piece shapes in EoE are
    ``{N}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact`` (Nutrient Block,
    Dubious Delicacy, All-Fates Scroll, Thaumaton Torpedo),
    ``{N}, {T}, Sacrifice a Food`` (Ragost),
    ``{N}, {T}, Sacrifice another artifact or land``
    (Slagdrill Scrapper), and ``{N}, {T}, Sacrifice a land``
    (Kavaron, Memorial World back face).

``<effect>`` is a single sentence parsed via the unified
``_parse_effect`` after lowercase + period stripping. Cost shapes
not on the supported list ("tap another permanent", 4+ comma
pieces, exile-from-graveyard, tap-X-other, etc.) cause the line to
fall through and the card to be skipped. The
"Remove a +1/+1 counter from a creature you control" cost atom IS
supported via the bag-merge classifier; multi-target counter-removal
("remove N counters from <subset>") and counter-removal phrases
that target the source itself are still out of scope.

After a successful parse, the resulting ``ActivatedAbility`` is
inspected: if its effect is a mana ability (e.g. ``AddManaToPool``
producing mana with no targets), the ability is rebuilt with
``is_mana_ability=True`` so the engine bypasses the stack at
activation time per CR 605.

The ``Activate only as a sorcery.`` rider has two surface shapes:

  * **Inline** — ``{cost}: <effect>. Activate only as a sorcery.`` is a
    single oracle line ending in the rider. ``_parse_activated_ability_line``
    strips the trailing rider and parses the remainder as a normal
    activation, returning an ``ActivatedAbility(..., sorcery_speed=True)``.
    This is the only shape EoE actually uses.
  * **Standalone** — a separate ``Activate only as a sorcery.`` line that
    attaches to the immediately preceding activated ability on the same
    card. Recognized by ``_is_sorcery_rider_line`` and handled by the
    creature builder, not here. Currently unused by EoE but kept for
    completeness.
