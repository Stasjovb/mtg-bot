"""Planeswalker ``CardPrinting`` builder — oracle-text driven.

A printed planeswalker line is one of:

* a *loyalty-activated* ability — a line whose printed cost is the
  ``[+−]?<digit(s)>:`` loyalty prefix (Scryfall renders the negative
  sign as the U+2212 minus character ``−``, the positive sign as ``+``,
  and bare zero as ``0:``);
* a keyword line (``Flash``);
* a planeswalker static (see ``_STATIC_LINE_RECOGNIZERS``);
* a triggered ability (the unified triggered-ability grammar, plus the
  "When ~ enters and at the beginning of <when>, <effect>." two-arm
  shape handled here).

Every recognized loyalty line becomes an :class:`ActivatedAbility`
with:

  * ``cost=ActivationCost(loyalty=N)`` — the signed loyalty cost. A
    printed ``+2`` ability stamps ``loyalty=-2`` (ADD); a printed
    ``-3`` ability stamps ``loyalty=3`` (PAY); ``0:`` stamps
    ``loyalty=0``. Mirrors Rust's sign convention exactly.
  * ``sorcery_speed=True`` — loyalty abilities are inherently
    sorcery-speed (CR 606.3 timing: only as a sorcery, your main phase,
    empty stack). The Wandering Emperor's static lifts this the turn
    she entered (``legal._instant_speed_loyalty_activations``).
  * ``effect`` — the loyalty body parsed through the unified effect
    grammar (``_parse_spell_effect_phrase``), after the Tezzeret,
    Cruel Captain literal table (``_LOYALTY_ABILITY_EFFECTS``).

**No partial claims.** A loyalty line whose body the grammar can't
parse — like any other unrecognized line — makes the whole card fall
through (returns ``None``). Earlier revisions STRIPPED unrecognized
loyalty bodies, which "claimed" seven cube planeswalkers (Jace, the
Mind Sculptor; Oko; Wrenn and Six; Teferi, Hero of Dominaria; Karn,
Scion of Urza; Chandra, Torch of Defiance; Dack Fayden) with zero
loyalty abilities. That violated the parser's no-silent-no-op rule and
was removed.
