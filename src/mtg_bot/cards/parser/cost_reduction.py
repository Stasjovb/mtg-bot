"""Spell cost-reduction rider parser.

Recognizes a single oracle-text line of the shape::

    This spell costs {N} less to cast if <condition>.

and produces a ``CostReduction(amount=N, condition=<Condition>)`` that
callers attach to a ``CardPrinting`` via the ``cost_reductions`` kwarg
on ``make_creature`` / ``make_instant`` / ``make_sorcery``.

The same rider appears on both creatures (Gigastorm Titan, Lashwhip
Predator) and noncreature spells (Dark Endurance, Temporal
Intervention), so the recognizer is factored out here and reused by
both the creature builder and the spell builder.

Variable-amount riders of the shape::

    This spell costs {X} less to cast, where X is <land-group-phrase>.

are also recognized via the ``PerDifferentlyNamedLand`` condition
(Fungal Colossus). The reduction is computed at cast time by the
engine's ``apply_cost_reductions`` — the unit ``amount=1`` is
multiplied by ``condition.multiplier`` (the count of distinctly named
lands the controller controls).

``Affinity for <type>`` keyword lines are recognized by the
``_parse_affinity_line`` function at the bottom of this module.
Reminder text is stripped before that function is called, so the
bare ``Affinity for Slivers`` form (not the parenthesized reminder)
reaches the recognizer. Produces ``CostReduction(amount=1,
condition=PerControlled(HasSubtype("<type>")))`` per CR 702.41.

Out of scope this slice:

* Rider-only conditions used by activated abilities (Thaumaton
  Torpedo's ``This ability costs {3} less to activate if …``) —
  those live on ``ActivatedAbility.cost_reductions``, parsed
  elsewhere.

Adding a new condition: extend ``_COST_REDUCTION_CONDITIONS`` with the
verbatim oracle phrase mapped to a structural ``Condition`` object.
The ``Condition`` is consumed directly by
``actions._evaluate_cost_reduction`` via the single-dispatch path —
no engine-side entry needs to be added in lockstep.

#
# A leading ``Void — `` prefix on the rider (Temporal Intervention) is
# stripped via a third regex variant; the body's ``if`` clause body is
# the canonical Void-state phrase, which the recognizer maps to the
# ``VoidActiveCondition`` ``Condition``. The Void-prefix variant is its
# own regex (rather than letting the ``if`` clause body match a free-
# form Void description) because the prefix and the engine condition
# are tightly coupled — a future Void-prefixed cost-reduction with a
# different body would still want the ``VoidActiveCondition`` mapping,
# since every Void rider gates on the same state.
