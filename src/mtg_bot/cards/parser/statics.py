"""Static-ability grammar.

Two families of static-ability surface forms are recognized.

**Self-scope** ``As long as``-gated lines come in two shapes:

* **Leading** ``As long as <condition>, this creature gets +N/+N[ and has
  <keyword>].`` — the original shape. Cloudsculpt Technician and
  Gravblade Heavy in EoE.
* **Trailing** ``This creature gets +N/+N[ and has <keyword>] as long as
  <condition>.`` — the rider trails the P/T modifier. Brightspear
  Zealot in EoE prints in this form.

Both shapes share the same condition phrasebook and produce identical
``StaticAbility`` outputs; the parser tries the leading regex first
and falls back to the trailing regex.

Recognized self-scope conditions today:

* ``you control an artifact`` →
  ``condition=ControlPermanent(IsArtifact())`` (Cloudsculpt Technician,
  Gravblade Heavy).
* ``you've cast two or more spells this turn`` →
  ``condition=AtLeastNSpellsCastThisTurn(2)`` (Brightspear Zealot, via
  the trailing shape).
* ``you've cast three or more spells this turn`` →
  ``condition=AtLeastNSpellsCastThisTurn(3)``. Batch-11 forward-looking
  variant of the existing ``two or more`` phrase — same Condition
  cousin with a higher threshold. No EoE printing today uses this
  threshold but the Condition accepts any ``int >= 0`` and the surface
  phrasing is the natural one-word substitution from the ``two``
  variant; adding it keeps the parser ready for printings that
  raise the bar (and makes the threshold-vs-phrase mapping explicit
  in the phrasebook rather than implicit in regex generality).
* ``it's your turn`` → ``active_turn_only=True``. Forward-looking
  grammar coverage; no EoE card prints in the leading/trailing
  self-scope shape with this condition today, but the engine field
  exists and the surface phrase is unambiguous.

Other "As long as" conditions (entered-this-turn, void, you-control-a-
creature, etc.) have no matching engine gate; they intentionally don't
match and the card falls through.

**Anthem-scope** lines target other permanents, not the source. Surface
shapes recognized:

* ``Creatures you control get +N/+M.`` →
  ``StaticScope.CREATURES_YOU_CONTROL`` with the P/T bonus.
* ``Other creatures you control get +N/+M.`` →
  ``StaticScope.OTHER_CREATURES_YOU_CONTROL`` with the P/T bonus.
* ``Creatures you control have <keyword>.`` /
  ``Other creatures you control have <keyword>.`` — keyword-only
  anthems (Tannuk-shape; ``power_bonus``/``toughness_bonus`` stay 0).
* ``... get +N/+M and have <keyword>.`` — combined P/T + keyword
  anthem.
* Optional leading ``During your turn, `` rider on any of the above
  sets ``active_turn_only=True``. Memorial Team Leader prints in this
  shape (``During your turn, other creatures you control get +1/+0.``).

Anthem lines do NOT carry an ``As long as`` condition today; the
self-scope condition phrasebook is therefore not consulted. If a future
printing combines the two we would extend the anthem regex rather than
the self-scope regex (the two surface families have already diverged
enough that a single combined grammar would be hard to read).

**Counter-gated anthem** lines name a per-creature counter filter as
part of the subject rather than as an ``As long as`` condition:

* ``Each creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it has
  <keyword>.`` → ``StaticScope.CREATURES_YOU_CONTROL_WITH_COUNTER``
  with the keyword grant. Drix Fatemaker prints in this shape. The
  scope itself is what carries the "filter to creatures with a
  +1/+1 counter" semantics — the engine's ``applies_to`` checks
  ``target.plus_one_counters > 0`` for this scope. Subject is
  ``Each creature`` (singular, no ``Other`` variant in EoE today)
  and the verb is therefore ``has`` rather than the plural-anthem
  ``have``.

# ---------- Anthem-scope grammar ----------
#
# Anthem lines target permanents other than (or including) the source.
# The ``subject`` group captures the surface noun phrase and is mapped
# verbatim to a ``StaticScope`` via ``_ANTHEM_SUBJECT_SCOPES`` — a
# dedicated mapping (rather than reusing ``_STATIC_CONDITION_KWARGS``)
# because subject-vs-condition are orthogonal axes: anthem lines may
# carry a turn-scope rider but never an ``As long as`` clause today,
# so co-locating the two would conflate independent dimensions.
#
# Two body shapes are accepted:
#
# * ``get +N/+M[ and have <keyword>]`` — P/T anthem, optionally with a
#   keyword grant tail. Mirrors the self-scope rider's ``and has``
#   spelling but uses ``and have`` because the subject is plural.
# * ``have <keyword>`` — keyword-only anthem (Tannuk's "Other creatures
#   you control have haste."), with no P/T component.
#
# An optional leading ``During your turn, `` prefix on either body
# sets ``active_turn_only=True``; this is the only "anthem condition"
# surface form in EoE today (Memorial Team Leader). The parser tries
# the P/T regex first and falls back to the keyword-only regex; both
# share the same ``subject`` and ``turn_rider`` groups so the shared
# parse function reads either match by name.

    [get|have] ...`` lines, optionally with a ``During your turn,``
    rider. Finally the counter-gated anthem grammar
    (``_parse_counter_gated_anthem_line``) is tried for the
    ``Each creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it has
    <keyword>.`` shape.

    The grammar families are mutually exclusive on their subject noun
    phrase (``this creature`` vs. ``[Other ]Creatures you control``
    vs. ``Each creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it``), so
    the order of fallthrough doesn't matter for correctness — self-
    scope is tried first only because every ``StaticAbility`` produced
    by the parser before the anthem grammar landed was self-scoped,
    and keeping that path first minimizes diff churn for the existing
    test corpus.
