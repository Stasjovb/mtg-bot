"""Opening-hand action lines (CR 103.6) -> ``BeginGameOnBattlefield``.

One parameterized recognizer for the printed shape::

    If this card is in your opening hand[ and you're not the starting
    player], you may begin the game with <it | <card name>> on the
    battlefield[ with a/an <kind> counter on it].[ If you do, exile
    a/one/two card(s) from your hand.]

Gemstone Caverns uses every optional part; the Leyline cycle's "If this
card is in your opening hand, you may begin the game with it on the
battlefield." is the bare form (Leyline of Mutation, EoE-era pool, still
goes through the enchantment builder's honest-no-op list -- see
``docs/SEARCH_LIMITATIONS.md``; routing it here is a one-line change
whenever that pool's parses may move).
