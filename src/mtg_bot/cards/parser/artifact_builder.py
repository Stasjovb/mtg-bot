"""Pure-Artifact ``CardPrinting`` builder.

A "pure" Artifact is a card whose type line is exactly ``"Artifact"``
(or ``"Legendary Artifact"`` / an ``"Artifact - <subtype>"`` form like
Food) **and** is not also a Creature, Equipment, or Spacecraft. Those
sister card types each have their own dedicated builder
(``creature_builder``, ``equipment_builder``, ``spacecraft_builder``)
with builder-specific grammar, so this builder claims only the
remainder.

The grammar this builder claims today is the simplest end-to-end shape
we can compose from the unified ``_parse_clause`` orchestrator already
used by the creature and spacecraft builders:

- zero or more keyword lines (e.g. ``"Indestructible"``);
- zero or more triggered ability lines (typed self-triggers like
  ``"When this artifact enters, ..."`` whose effect resolves through
  the unified effect grammar);
- zero or more activated ability lines (printed-cost activations like
  ``"{3}, Sacrifice this artifact: <effect>."``);
- zero or more static ability lines that the unified static parser
  already recognizes.

Anything outside that — composite triggers (``"...enters or
leaves..."``), state-based zone-change triggers
(``"is put into a graveyard"``), affinity-style cost reductions,
quoted granted abilities, or any line the unified parser doesn't
recognize — falls through and the artifact is silently skipped,
mirroring the creature/spell/land/equipment/spacecraft builders.

Today the EoE pure-artifacts the unified clause grammar claims are:

* **Melded Moxite** — typed-self ETB optional discard-then-draw plus a
  ``{3}, Sacrifice this artifact`` token-creating activation.
* **Thaumaton Torpedo** — single ``{6}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact``
  activation with a ``destroy target nonland permanent`` payload and
  the inline ``This ability costs {3} less to activate if you attacked
  with a Spacecraft this turn.`` cost-reduction rider.
* **Cryogen Relic** — compound ``"enters or leaves the battlefield"``
  trigger drawing a card on each arm, plus a ``{1}{U}, Sacrifice this
  artifact`` activation that puts a stun counter on up to one tapped
  creature.
* **Dubious Delicacy** — Flash, an ``up to one`` optional ETB debuff
  ``-3/-3 UEOT``, and two ``{2}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact``
  activations (gain 3 life / target opponent loses 3 life).
* **Nutrient Block** — Indestructible, ``{2}, {T}, Sacrifice this
  artifact: You gain 3 life.``, and the graveyard-from-battlefield
  zone-change trigger drawing a card (modeled via LEAVES_BATTLEFIELD
  to match the static-registry simplification).

In addition, several single-card oracle-line shapes that were once
matched as literal strings against a bespoke-class registry now
decompose into generic primitives via the unified ``_parse_clause``
grammar (the multi-sentence literal-effect recognizer in
``effects.py`` keeps the anaphoric body intact while still mapping
to a ``Sequence`` of generic primitives):

* **Requiem Monolith** — ``{T}: Until end of turn, target creature
  gains "Whenever this creature is dealt damage, you draw that many
  cards and lose that much life." That creature's controller may
  have this artifact deal 1 damage to it. Activate only as a sorcery.``
  decomposes into ``Sequence(GrantTriggeredAbilityUEOT(ability=
  TriggeredAbility(trigger="this_dealt_damage", effect=DrawCardsAnd
  LoseLifeEqualToResolvingDamage())), MayHaveSourceDealDamageToTarget
  (amount=1))`` via the multi-sentence literal recognizer in
  ``effects.py``. The trailing ``Activate only as a sorcery.`` rider
  flips ``sorcery_speed=True`` via the existing inline-rider strip in
  ``activated.py``.
* **Haunted Screen** — three activations. The first two are mana
  abilities claimed by the unified clause grammar via the
  ``add {<c1>} or {<c2>}`` / ``add {<c1>}, {<c2>}, or {<c3>}``
  recognizers mapping to ``AddNManaOfChosenColor``. The third
  ``{7}: Put seven +1/+1 counters on this artifact. It becomes a 0/0
  Spirit creature in addition to its other types. Activate only once.``
  decomposes into ``Sequence(PutPlusOneCounterOnSelf(amount=7),
  BecomeType(types_to_add=("creature",), subtypes_to_add=("Spirit",),
  base_pt=(0, 0)))`` via a multi-sentence literal recognizer in
  ``effects.py``. The trailing ``Activate only once.`` rider flips
  ``activate_only_once=True`` via the new inline-rider strip in
  ``activated.py``; the per-source ``has_activated_once_only_ability``
  flag is now latched at the activation gate (``_activate_ability``
  in ``actions.py``) and read by ``legal_actions`` to filter out
  re-activation.
* **All-Fates Scroll** — two-line activation, both claimed via the
  unified clause grammar: ``{T}: Add one mana of any color.`` parses
  through the existing ``add one mana of any color`` recognizer, and
  ``{7}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Draw X cards, where X is the
  number of differently named lands you control.`` parses through
  the new ``draw X cards, where X is the number of differently named
  lands you control`` recognizer mapping to the generic
  ``DrawCardsByConditionMultiplier(condition=PerDifferentlyNamedLand
  (), description_fragment=…)``.
* **The Endstone** (Legendary) — both trigger lines now claim through
  the unified ``_parse_clause`` grammar. The composite ``Whenever you
  play a land or cast a spell, draw a card.`` parses via the new
  ``"you play a land or cast a spell"`` entry in
  ``_COMPOUND_PREDICATE_TRIGGER_PHRASES`` (one ``TriggeredAbility``
  per arm — IS_CAST and PLAYS_LAND, both gated on
  ``Controlled(YOU, subject="controller")``); ``At the beginning of
  your end step, your life total becomes half your starting life
  total, rounded up.`` parses via the existing ``"your end step"``
  ``_AT_BEGINNING_OF_PHRASES`` entry plus the new
  ``"your life total becomes half your starting life total, rounded
  up"`` literal-phrase recognizer in ``effects.py`` mapping to the
  generic ``SetLifeToHalfStartingRoundedUp`` engine class.
* **Pinnacle Starcage** — the ETB line ``When this artifact enters,
  exile all artifacts and creatures with mana value 2 or less until
  this artifact leaves the battlefield.`` claims through the unified
  clause grammar via the existing ``"this artifact enters"`` predicate
  trigger phrase plus the ``_EXILE_ALL_MATCHING_UNTIL_LEAVES``
  effect-phrase regex in ``effects.py`` (mapping to the generic
  ``ExileAllMatchingUntilSourceLeaves(match_artifact=True,
  match_creature=True, max_mv=2)`` engine class). The activation
  ``{6}{W}{W}: Put each card exiled ... Sacrifice this artifact.``
  decomposes into a ``Sequence`` of three new generic primitives via
  the multi-sentence literal-effect recognizer in ``effects.py``:
  ``MoveEachExiledWithSourceToOwnersGraveyard`` (the recall side of
  the new "exiled-with-this" infrastructure), ``CreateNTokensFromLast
  ExileRecall(token_name="Robot")`` (reads
  ``state.last_exile_recall_count`` set by the recall step), and
  ``SacrificeSelf`` (effect-body sacrifice; the printed
  ``Sacrifice this artifact`` is part of the body, not the cost).
* **Ghost Vacuum** — two activations. The first ability
  ``{T}: Exile target card from a graveyard.`` parses through the
  unified activated grammar via the ``ExileTargetCardFromGraveyard``
  primitive (which tags the chosen card with
  ``exiled_by_source = source.id`` so the recall side has something
  to consume). The second ``{6}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact``
  recall body decomposes into the parameterized
  ``PutEachCreatureCardExiledWithSourceOntoBattlefieldUnderYour
  Control`` primitive (with ``grant_flying_counter=True`` and
  ``grant_subtype_and_pt=("Spirit", 1, 1)``) via the multi-sentence
  literal-effect recognizer in ``effects.py``.

Two additional cards are claimed via the expanded unified grammar
(historically claimed by the now-retired ``_BESPOKE_ARTIFACT_BUILDERS``
table — both factories were deleted on 2026-05-01):

* **Thrumming Hivepool** — ``Affinity for Slivers`` keyword line
  (parsed by the new ``_parse_affinity_line`` recognizer in
  ``cost_reduction.py``) → ``CostReduction(amount=1, condition=
  PerControlled(HasSubtype("Sliver")))``. ``Slivers you control have
  double strike and haste.`` anthem (new ``"slivers you control"``
  entry in ``_ANTHEM_SUBJECT_SCOPES`` in ``statics.py`` with
  multi-keyword " and "-split logic) → ``StaticAbility(scope=
  SLIVERS_YOU_CONTROL, granted_keywords={"double strike","haste"})``.
  ``At the beginning of your upkeep, create two 1/1 colorless Sliver
  creature tokens.`` trigger (new ``"your upkeep"`` entry in
  ``_AT_BEGINNING_OF_PHRASES`` in ``triggers.py``).
* **Found Footage** — ``You may look at face-down creatures your
  opponents control any time.`` claims via
  ``_parse_looks_at_opponents_face_down_line`` (a printing-keyword
  recognizer in ``printing_keywords.py`` alongside Warp / Ward /
  Devour / Impending), which sets
  ``looks_at_opponents_face_down_creatures=True`` on
  ``make_artifact``. ``{2}, Sacrifice this artifact: Surveil 2, then
  draw a card.`` (unified ``_parse_clause`` activated-ability grammar).
  The Clue subtype is extracted from the Scryfall type-line via the
  new ``artifact_subtype`` step in ``_build_artifact_printing``.

Pure artifacts share the unified clause grammar with creatures - no
``Equipped creature ...`` or ``Station`` lines appear here - so this
builder is structurally simpler than the equipment and spacecraft
builders: it just dispatches each line through ``_parse_clause`` and
sorts the result into the appropriate ``make_artifact`` bucket. The
literal-line table is consulted FIRST — a recognized literal short-
circuits the unified ``_parse_clause`` dispatch for that one line so
the bespoke effect class is preserved end-to-end.
