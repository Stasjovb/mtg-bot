"""Parser grammar for the roto cards that change card types and colors
(CR 613 layers 4 and 5): Mycosynth Lattice, Liquimetal Coating, Unable to
Scream and Karn, the Great Creator (``docs/EFFECTIVE_CHARACTERISTICS_
DESIGN.md``).

Entry points, each the last fallback of a shared dispatcher (so no phrase
an older recognizer claims changes meaning), switched off for printings
that exist only in the EoE-era dumps through the shared
``creature_rmc_grammar`` guard:

* :data:`LAYER_LINE_RECOGNIZERS` -- whole oracle lines, appended to P5's
  ``roto_board._LINE_RECOGNIZERS`` (artifact / creature / cube
  enchantment builders): "All permanents are <type>s in addition to their
  other types.", the all-objects color line, "Players may spend mana as
  though it were mana of any color.", Unable to Scream's two Aura lines;
* :func:`parse_roto_layer_effect` -- effect phrases (after P6 in
  ``effects._parse_effect``): "target <np> becomes a[n] <types> ...",
  Karn's -2 wish-or-exile body;
* :func:`parse_all_objects_color_line` -- shared with the creature
  grammar's Painter's Servant line (one parameterized recognizer for both
  printed surfaces).

Karn's static ("Activated abilities of artifacts your opponents control
can't be activated.") is the activation-lock recognizer of the W/G creature
lines, widened with the controller scope (``creature_wg_lines.
_parse_activation_lock_line``) and reached from the planeswalker builder.
