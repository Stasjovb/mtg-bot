"""Effect grammar for card-flow spell shapes: targeted draw, tutors,
hand disruption, library look-and-select, wheels, mass zone moves and
a few mana / library primitives.

Hooked into ``effects._parse_effect`` as the LAST dispatch step (after
every pre-existing recognizer), so no phrase an older recognizer
already claims changes meaning; these recognizers only claim phrases
nothing else did. Everything here is parameterized — the varying parts
of a printed shape (amounts, card descriptors, destinations, the
"may" rider) are capture groups — and multi-sentence shapes recurse
into ``_parse_effect`` for their trailing sentences, so a new card with
the same shape costs zero code.

Every phrase reaching this module is *normalized* (see
``effects._normalize_spell_effect_phrase``): no trailing period and a
lower-cased first letter. Later sentences inside a multi-sentence
phrase keep their original capitalization, hence the ``[Yy]ou`` style
alternations.
