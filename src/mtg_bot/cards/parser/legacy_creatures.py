"""Creature lines of the Legacy cards outside the cube (pool ``legacy``).

The mtg-zero Rust engine plays a Legacy Izzet Delver mirror whose 60 cards
are cube cards but for Murktide Regent and Prismari Charm (Prismari Charm
already parses). Murktide Regent's lines:

* ``Delve`` on a creature -> ``CardPrinting.has_delve`` (CR 702.66; the
  spell builder's ``Delve`` line, for a creature spell).
* ``This creature enters with a +1/+1 counter on it for each instant and
  sorcery card exiled with it.`` ->
  ``CardPrinting.enters_with_counter_per_card_exiled_with_it`` = the card
  filter (CR 607.2q: "exiled with it" = the cards exiled to pay the cost of
  the spell that became this permanent; 614.1c).
* ``Whenever an instant or sorcery card leaves your graveyard, put a +1/+1
  counter on this creature.`` -> a ``TriggeredAbility`` on
  ``Event.LEAVES_GRAVEYARD`` (subjects ``player``: the graveyard's owner,
  ``card``: the card as it was there, CR 603.10a).

"<types> card" names printed card types (cards outside the battlefield
have only their printed characteristics): ``HasPrintedCardType`` per
type, joined with ``ObjectOr`` ("instant and sorcery card" = each card
that is an instant or a sorcery, as "instant or sorcery card").

The Python engine doesn't play these two abilities (entering with the
field raises; no dispatch site fires ``LEAVES_GRAVEYARD``): they are data
for the card IR (SEARCH_LIMITATIONS, "Legacy pool" 1).
