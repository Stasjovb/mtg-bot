"""Triggered-ability grammar.

A triggered-ability line of the form ``When/Whenever <condition>,
<effect>.`` decomposes into a condition phrase and an effect phrase.
Each is handled by its own parser — the condition by
``_parse_trigger_phrase`` (a literal-phrase lookup against
``_TRIGGER_PHRASES`` and ``_PREDICATE_TRIGGER_PHRASES``), the effect
by ``_parse_effect_phrase`` from ``effects``. Adding a new condition
or effect grows its respective grammar without touching the line-
level pattern.

Two trigger shapes coexist during the predicate-trigger migration:

- **String-key style** (legacy): the condition phrase maps to a flat
  string key (``"dies"``, ``"attacks"``, …) and the engine's per-event
  ``_fire_*`` functions hardcode-match it. Phases later than this one
  will migrate the remaining string-key keys to the predicate path.
- **Predicate style** (new): the condition phrase maps to an
  ``(Event, Predicate)`` pair and the engine's centralized
  ``dispatch_event`` walks every triggered ability looking for a
  matching ``event`` whose ``predicate`` evaluates true. Phase 2
  migrated the ENTERS-event family (``etb`` / ``landfall`` /
  ``artifact_enters_you_control`` and the qualified variants); phase 4
  migrated the DIES / LEAVES_BATTLEFIELD families (this-creature-dies,
  this-creature-leaves-the-battlefield, counter-creature-dies, and
  the broader your-creature-or-artifact-dies / another-creature-dies-
  or-exiled observer patterns); phase 5 migrated the ATTACKS family
  (this-creature-attacks); phase 6 migrated the turn-structure family
  (``beginning_of_upkeep`` / ``beginning_of_combat`` /
  ``beginning_of_end_step`` and the ``each``-end-step variant) — these
  trigger keys aren't produced by oracle-text parsing (every
  turn-structure trigger is wired directly in the static-card
  registries) so this module's parser tables stay unchanged for that
  phase, but the engine-side predicate dispatch now subsumes the
  string-key path. Phase 7 migrated the BECOMES_TAPPED family
  (this-creature-becomes-tapped — parsed from oracle text — plus the
  aura ``enchanted_permanent_becomes_tapped`` variant which is only
  built statically) and the aura/equipment relational ATTACKS variants
  (``enchanted_creature_attacks``, ``equipped_creature_attacks``) plus
  the aura DEALT_DAMAGE family (``enchanted_creature_dealt_damage``)
  — all built directly in static-card registries via the new
  ``IsHost`` predicate, so the parser tables grow only by the
  ``this creature becomes tapped`` entry moving from
  ``_TRIGGER_PHRASES`` to ``_PREDICATE_TRIGGER_PHRASES``. Batch 11
  added the type-qualified self-ETB / self-attack family
  (``this Spacecraft enters``, ``this artifact enters``,
  ``this enchantment enters``, ``this Aura enters``,
  ``this Spacecraft attacks``) — every entry maps to the same
  ``IsSelf()`` predicate as the pre-existing ``"this creature
  enters"`` / ``"this creature attacks"`` siblings because the
  predicate's object-identity check is type-blind. The phrases are
  forward-looking grammar coverage today: every EoE printing that
  carries them is a non-creature card type that doesn't flow through
  the creature-builder ``_parse_clause`` pipeline.

Some triggered-ability lines are prefixed by an *ability-word* label
followed by an em-dash (e.g. ``Landfall — Whenever a land you
control enters, …``). Ability words are reminder labels with no
rules consequence — the substance is the ``Whenever …`` clause that
follows. ``_strip_ability_word_prefix`` strips any such label
generically so the body parses through the normal grammar; we never
need to enumerate ability words individually.

    #    this <subject> unless <void-gate>``): the gate phrase
