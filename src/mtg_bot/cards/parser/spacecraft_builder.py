"""Artifact - Spacecraft ``CardPrinting`` builder.

Spacecraft are an Edge of Eternities-only card type printed as
``Artifact - Spacecraft``. They enter as non-creature artifacts and
become artifact creatures with a printed ``power``/``toughness`` and
a set of stationed keywords once they accumulate a printed number of
charge counters via the ``Station`` ability. The static registry
models them through ``make_spacecraft(name, cost, power, toughness,
station_threshold, stationed_keywords, ...)``.

The printed oracle text follows a uniform skeleton:

- One ``Station (Tap another creature you control: Put charge counters
  equal to its power on this Spacecraft. Station only as a sorcery.
  It's an artifact creature at <N>+.)`` line. The ``<N>`` here is
  always the same number that gates the highest tier-keyword line and
  also the engine's ``station_threshold``.
- Zero or more "tier" lines of the form ``"<N>+ | <body>"``. The
  highest tier is always the keyword grant that the engine encodes as
  ``stationed_keywords`` and ``station_threshold``. Lower tiers are
  static, triggered, or activated abilities gated on charge counters
  via ``StaticAbility.tier_threshold`` / ``TriggeredAbility.tier_threshold``.
- Zero or more "ETB" / standalone trigger lines (``"When this
  Spacecraft enters, ..."``, ``"Whenever this Spacecraft attacks,
  ..."``, etc.) and/or a printed activated ability.

This builder grew in several slices:

- **Slice 1** claimed the simplest end-to-end shape: the Station
  reminder line plus a single ``"<N>+ | <evergreen-keyword-list>"``
  tier line whose threshold matches the Station threshold. The
  keyword list is comma-joined evergreens from ``_KEYWORD_LINES``.
- **Slice 2** extends the grammar to claim a single
  ``"When this Spacecraft enters, <effect>."`` ETB trigger alongside
  the Station + tier-keyword pair. The trigger line is parsed by the
  unified ``_parse_clause`` orchestrator — the type-qualified self-ETB
  predicate-trigger phrase ``this Spacecraft enters`` already lives in
  ``triggers._PREDICATE_TRIGGER_PHRASES`` (added in batch 11), and any
  ETB whose effect phrase resolves through ``effects._parse_effect_phrase``
  becomes a ``TriggeredAbility`` we hand straight to
  ``make_spacecraft(triggered_abilities=...)``. Spacecraft whose ETB
  effect is outside the effect grammar (e.g. ``return target creature
  or enchantment card from your graveyard``) still fall through.
- **Slice 3** extended the trigger arm two ways. First,
  ``Whenever this Spacecraft attacks, <effect>.`` lines are accepted
  alongside the self-ETB shape — the type-qualified self-attack
  predicate-trigger phrase ``this Spacecraft attacks`` lives in the
  same ``_PREDICATE_TRIGGER_PHRASES`` table the self-ETB phrase uses,
  so the only change is the per-line dispatch widening to admit the
  ``Event.ATTACKS, IsSelf()`` shape. Second, the defensive Legendary
  skip is dropped — ``_parse_type_line``'s ``Legendary`` supertype is
  forwarded to ``make_spacecraft(legendary=True)`` so a Legendary
  Spacecraft whose body falls inside the supported grammar can be
  claimed.
- **Slice 4** extends the ``"<N>+ | <body>"`` tier-line
  arm to claim **tier-gated triggered abilities**. A tier-line body
  that isn't a pure evergreen keyword list is re-tried through
  ``_parse_clause``; if it parses to a self-ETB or self-ATTACKS
  ``TriggeredAbility`` the trigger is added to the Spacecraft's
  trigger list with ``tier_threshold=N`` so the engine's
  ``TriggeredAbility.tier_threshold`` gate fires only when the
  Spacecraft has enough charge counters. Multi-tier static
  **keyword** grants — the Synthesizer Labship shape — were
  considered as a companion arm but rejected: the engine's
  ``StaticAbility.applies_to`` requires the target be a creature now,
  and every real EoE printing's lower-tier keyword line falls below
  the Station threshold (i.e. while the Spacecraft is still an
  artifact, not a creature), so a self-scoped ``StaticAbility`` with
  ``tier_threshold=N`` would never fire. Modeling those grants
  correctly needs an engine-side change to ``stationed_keywords``
  (tier-keyed keyword sets) and is left for a future slice.
- **Slice 5** (this batch) extends the tier-line arm a third way to
  claim **tier-gated anthem statics**. A tier-line body that re-parses
  through ``_parse_clause`` to a non-self-scoped ``StaticAbility``
  (``CREATURES_YOU_CONTROL`` or ``OTHER_CREATURES_YOU_CONTROL``) gets
  ``tier_threshold=N`` stamped on it and lands in
  ``make_spacecraft(static_abilities=...)``. Lumen-Class Frigate's
  ``2+ | Other creatures you control get +1/+1.`` is the EoE printing
  in this shape; the slice-4 rejection of tier-gated keyword statics
  doesn't apply because anthem scopes target *other* permanents and
  fire as soon as the Spacecraft has enough charge counters
  irrespective of whether the Spacecraft itself is animated.
- **Slice 6** migrated the three remaining bespoke entries whose effects
  were previously outside the unified grammar: Entropic Battlecruiser,
  Synthesizer Labship, and Dawnsire, Sunstar Dreadnought. Three
  effect-grammar additions unlocked them:

  1. ``"they lose N life"`` → ``TargetPlayerLosesLife(amount=N)`` (for
     DISCARDS_CARD observer effects where "they" is the pre-wired target).
  2. Multi-sentence literal for ``"each opponent discards a card. Each
     opponent who can't loses N life"`` → ``EachOpponentDiscardsOrLosesLife``.
  3. Parameterized regex for ``"up to one other target artifact you control
     becomes an artifact creature with base power and toughness P/T and
     gains <keywords> until end of turn"`` →
     ``TargetArtifactBecomesCreatureUEOT``.

  Additionally the trigger-condition phrasebook gains
  ``"an opponent discards a card"`` → ``(Event.DISCARDS_CARD,
  Controlled(OPPONENT))`` and the tier-gated trigger arm in this builder
  is widened to accept three new (event, predicate) shapes:
  ``DISCARDS_CARD + Controlled(OPPONENT)`` (Entropic Battlecruiser),
  ``BEGINNING_OF_COMBAT + Controlled(YOU)`` (Synthesizer Labship), and
  ``YOU_ATTACK + Controlled(YOU)`` (Dawnsire). The
  ``_DEAL_DAMAGE_UP_TO_ONE_TARGET_CREATURE`` regex is also extended
  to accept a leading ``(?:this creature )?`` prefix and a trailing
  ``(?: or planeswalker)?`` suffix so Dawnsire's
  ``this creature deals 100 damage to up to one target creature or
  planeswalker`` effect phrase claims correctly.

- **Slice 7** migrated The Eternity Elevator (the last remaining
  bespoke entry) into the unified grammar. Three grammar gaps were
  closed:

  1. **Missing P/T**: non-animating Spacecraft have no printed P/T in
     the Scryfall record; the builder now falls back to ``power=0,
     toughness=0`` instead of bailing, matching ``make_spacecraft``'s
     defaults for the non-creature case.
  2. **Non-animating Station line**: a second regex
     ``_STATION_LINE_NO_ANIMATION_RE`` matches the Station reminder text
     without the ``"It's an artifact creature at N+."`` sub-clause.
     Matching sets ``station_seen=True`` but leaves
     ``station_threshold=None`` so the engine never animates the card.
  3. **Tier-gated activated ability**: the ``"N+ | {cost}: <effect>"``
     tier-line arm is widened to accept an activated ability (in addition
     to the existing keyword / trigger / anthem-static arms). The
     activation is tagged with ``tier_threshold=N`` so
     ``effective_activated_abilities`` hides it below the threshold.
     Two new effect-grammar entries support this:
     - ``_ADD_N_COLORLESS_MANA`` matches ``add {C}{C}…`` and produces
       ``AddManaToPool(produces=(("C", N),))`` — covering the Elevator's
       always-on ``{T}: Add {C}{C}{C}`` ability as well.
     - ``_ADD_X_MANA_ANY_COLOR_PER_CHARGE_COUNTER`` matches the normalized
       ``add X mana of any one color, where X is the number of charge
       counters on this creature`` phrase and produces
       ``AddChargeCounterManaOfChosenColor``.
     ``_is_mana_ability_effect`` in ``activated.py`` is widened to also
     return True for ``AddChargeCounterManaOfChosenColor`` so the engine
     bypasses the stack on activation per CR 605.

  After this slice every Spacecraft printing was claimed by the
  unified grammar; the bespoke dispatch table was retired in
  retire-empty-bespoke-shells.

Anything outside the supported shape - lower-tier static/activated
abilities, multiple tier-keyword lines (single-keyword-tier only is
claimed today), an ``X+`` body that isn't a bare keyword list and
isn't a self-trigger, activated, or anthem-static, or a missing Station
line - falls through and the Spacecraft is silently skipped, mirroring
the creature/spell/land/equipment builders.

Spacecraft live in their own module rather than extending the artifact/
equipment builders because the printed grammar (Station reminder text
+ tiered ``N+ |`` body lines) is structurally distinct from
``Equipped creature ...`` / ``Equip {N}`` and from plain artifact
oracle text. Folding those shapes together would require either
disjoint per-line regexes or per-builder branching that obscures the
narrow grammar each one actually claims.
