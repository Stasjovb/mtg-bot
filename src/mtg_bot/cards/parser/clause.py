"""Top-level clause dispatch.

A creature's oracle text is parsed line-by-line. Each line that
isn't a special pre-clause check (Warp, Ward, sorcery-speed rider —
those live in ``printing_keywords`` and ``activated``) goes through
``_parse_clause`` which dispatches to the per-clause-type parsers
in keyword/trigger/activated/static order.

The result, ``_ParsedClause``, is a small dataclass with mutually
exclusive populated fields — the creature builder consumes it by
inspecting which field is set.
