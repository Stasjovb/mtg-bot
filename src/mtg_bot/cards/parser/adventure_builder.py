"""Adventurer cards (CR 715) and preparation cards (Secrets of
Strixhaven "prepare") -- two different two-face layouts whose card is a
creature card in every zone but the stack.

* ``layout == "adventure"`` (Brazen Borrower // Petty Theft): the creature
  face's printing (keyed by the full card name) carries the Adventure half
  in ``adventure_face``. The card may be cast as either; a spell cast as
  an Adventure is exiled as it resolves and its controller may later cast
  the creature from exile (``layouts.exile_on_adventure``).
* ``layout == "prepare"`` (Emeritus of Abundance // Regrowth): the second
  face is the creature's *prepare spell* (``prepare_spell``). The card can
  only be cast as the creature (its base characteristics); when the
  creature becomes prepared its controller gets a castable copy of the
  prepare spell in exile (``layouts.become_prepared``).

Both faces must build through the regular builders (a face is a card
record with ``layout == "normal"``) or the card isn't claimed.
