"""Double-faced card builder (CR 712) -- cube layouts bucket.

Scryfall stores a double-faced card as one record whose ``card_faces``
array carries each face's name, mana cost, type line, oracle text,
P/T / loyalty and colors. Each face is built on its own through the
regular per-type builders (a face is just a card record with
``layout == "normal"``), then the two are joined:

* ``layout == "transform"`` -- the front face's printing (renamed to the
  full card name, the pool / deck key) carries the back face in
  ``transform_back_face``. The back face borrows the front face's mana
  cost for its mana value (CR 712.8e) and takes its colors from its
  color indicator (``face_colors``).
* ``layout == "modal_dfc"`` with a permanent front face -- the back face
  is either a land the card may be played as (``mdfc_back_face``, the
  base's spell // land substrate) or a castable face of its own
  (``mdfc_back_face`` again; ``legal_actions`` offers casting it). A
  front face with a "Transform ~" ability also gets the back face as
  ``transform_back_face``. Modal DFCs whose front face is an instant or
  sorcery stay with ``spell_builder._build_mdfc_spell_printing``.

The whole card is claimed only if both faces build.
