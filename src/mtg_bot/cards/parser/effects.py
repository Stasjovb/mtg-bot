"""Unified effect grammar shared by creature triggered abilities and
spells.

Each shape's regex matches the *normalized* effect phrase — no
source-subject prefix (``it`` for creature triggers or ``<Name>``
for spells), no trailing period, first letter lowercased. Surface
preprocessing (the ``_normalize_*`` helpers below) strips the
per-context noise before dispatch, so both contexts share one
effect grammar — adding a new effect here makes it available to
creature triggered abilities and to spells (single-line and
multi-line) at the same time.
