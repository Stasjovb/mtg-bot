"""Artifact — Equipment ``CardPrinting`` builder.

Equipment is a narrow, uniform shape on Scryfall: keyword line(s) +
one or more ``Equipped creature`` clauses + an ``Equip {N}`` line +
optional ETB triggers. The grammar this builder claims today covers:

- a single static "``Equipped creature gets +N/+M``" clause, optionally
  with a trailing ``" and has <keyword>[, <keyword>...]"`` rider that
  grants printed evergreen keywords to the equipped creature;
- a single "``Equipped creature has <keyword>``" clause as a standalone
  granted-keyword line;
- a standalone evergreen-keyword line on the Equipment itself (most
  often ``Flash``), routed to ``make_equipment(keywords=...)``;
- a single ETB trigger of the form
  ``"When this Equipment enters, attach it to target creature you
  control."`` (canonical ``AttachToTargetCreatureYouControl`` via
  ``IsSelf`` ENTERS), optionally with a trailing
  ``" That creature gains <keyword> until end of turn."`` rider that
  feeds ``granted_keywords_ueot=`` on the same effect — Squire's
  Lightblade and Illvoi Light Jammer ride this shape;
- a single ETB trigger of the form
  ``"When this Equipment enters, create a 2/2 colorless Robot artifact
  creature token and attach this Equipment to it."`` wired through
  ``CreateTokenAndAttachSelf`` against ``TOKEN_PRINTINGS["Robot"]`` —
  Auxiliary Boosters' bespoke ETB;
- a single ETB trigger of the form
  ``"When this Equipment enters, create a 1/1 white Glimmer
  enchantment creature token."`` wired through bare ``CreateToken``
  against ``TOKEN_PRINTINGS["Glimmer"]`` — Glimmerlight's ETB. Distinct
  from the Auxiliary Boosters shape because the Equipment does NOT
  attach to the created token;
- a single ETB trigger of the form
  ``"When this Equipment enters, manifest dread, then attach this
  Equipment to that creature."`` wired through the bespoke
  ``ManifestDreadThenAttachSelf`` engine class — Duskmourn Equipment
  family (Conductive Machete, Killer's Mask, Cursed Windbreaker,
  Dissection Tools). "That creature" refers back to the just-
  manifested face-down 2/2, parallel to the Slimy Aquarium / Weight
  Room door triggers' ``ManifestDreadThenPutPlusOneCountersOnIt``
  back-reference;
- Hylderblade's Void rider — a literal beginning-of-end-step
  attach-to-target-creature trigger gated on ``requires_void=True``
  (the engine's stand-in for the EoE intervening-if condition);
- Robe of Stars' Astral Projection activation — a flavor-named
  ``"<name> — <cost>: Equipped creature phases out."`` line wired
  into an ``ActivatedAbility`` whose effect is the bespoke
  ``PhaseOutEquippedCreature``;
- a closing ``"Equip {N}"`` line whose mana-cost token feeds
  ``make_equipment(equip_cost=...)``.

Anything outside that shape — ``Equipped creature has
"<granted activated ability>"``, the custom attack trigger on Atomic
Microsizer, or any line the per-line dispatcher doesn't recognize —
falls through and the Equipment is silently skipped, mirroring the
creature/spell/land builders.

These line phrases are equipment-specific ("Equipped creature ...",
"Equip {N}", "When this Equipment enters, ...") and don't fit the
creature-focused unified clause grammar in ``clause.py``, so they're
recognized here with narrow regexes scoped to this builder.
