"""Duskmourn Room ``CardPrinting`` builder.

CR 207.2g + 715: a Room is an enchantment with two halves; each half
has its own name, mana cost, and rules text. When a Room spell is
cast, the controller picks one half to cast for that half's mana
cost; the Room enters the battlefield with that half unlocked. The
other half is locked. The controller can later (sorcery speed) pay
the locked half's mana cost to unlock it.

Scryfall stores Rooms as a single card with a ``card_faces`` array
of two faces. Each face has its own ``mana_cost``, ``oracle_text``,
``name``, and ``type_line`` (always ``Enchantment — Room``). This
builder splits the two faces, parses each into a ``RoomHalf``
(name + mana cost + per-half abilities), and glues them together
via ``make_room`` into the parent ``CardPrinting``.

Single claim path: each face's oracle text walks through the unified
per-line grammar (``_parse_clause`` + ``_parse_triggered_ability_line``).
Door triggers (``"When you unlock this door, …"``) flow through
the predicate-trigger-phrasebook entry ``"you unlock this door"``
which maps to ``(Event.ENTERS, IsSelf())`` — the same shape the
per-half static-side wiring uses, gated through the Room's
per-half ``unlocked_halves`` set by ``make_room`` tagging the
flattened ability with ``room_half=<half-name>``.

Per-half oracle-text lines that map to engine-unmodeled mechanics
(trigger doubling, optional alt-cost permission, etc.) live on the
``_ROOM_HONEST_NOOP_LINES`` allowlist below; the half emits as
cost-and-name only for those lines. Same precedent as
``_NONAURA_HONEST_NOOP_LINES`` in ``enchantment_builder``.

Combined-card names that the unified-grammar path is allowed to
claim live on ``_UNIFIED_ROOM_NAMES``. Rooms outside the allowlist
are simply not claimed (they pass through the type-gate and return
``None``) — same silent-skip discipline the rest of the parser
applies to unclaimed cards. The allowlist serves as documentation
of "these Rooms have been audited end-to-end and the unified-path
output matches the printed surface".

    Walks the face's oracle text line-by-line, strips reminder text,

    half's name is threaded through to the trigger parser so a future
    "When you unlock <Half-Name>" surface (the parser's

    ``"this creature"`` form — today every Room prints
    ``"this door"`` so the substitution is a no-op.

    Returns ``None`` if any non-empty line fails to parse, so an
    unrecognized line surfaces as a parser miss for the whole face

    Lines on ``_ROOM_HONEST_NOOP_LINES`` are silently dropped — they
