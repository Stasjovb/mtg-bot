"""Phrasebook: printed "target …" noun phrase → ``TargetFilter``.

Each entry in :data:`_TARGET_PHRASE_TABLE` maps a printed surface
phrase (the bit *after* the ``target `` / ``any target`` keyword) to
the structural :class:`mtg_bot.effects.target_filter.TargetFilter`
that describes the legal-target set.

The phrasebook covers every shape encountered by the damage
recognizers in :mod:`mtg_bot.cards.parser.effects` plus the bare
"any target" form. Cards whose phrasing is uniquely "target X an
opponent controls" / "target X you control" / "target attacking or
blocking creature" all route through here so adding a new card with
the same phrasing is one entry, not a new effect class.

Public surface:

- :func:`parse_target_phrase` — return a ``TargetFilter`` for a
  recognized phrase, or ``None`` if the phrase isn't on the table.
- :data:`_TARGET_PHRASE_TABLE` — the underlying dict, exposed for
  introspection / parser tests.
