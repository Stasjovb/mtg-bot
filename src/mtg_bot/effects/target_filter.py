"""Target-filter grammar — what counts as a legal target for a
``TargetSpec``.

A ``TargetFilter`` answers "is this object a legal target for this
slot?" given the object plus the current ``GameState`` plus the
controller of the resolving spell/ability. The filter vocabulary is:

- ``ObjectPredicate`` — every predicate atom from
  :mod:`mtg_bot.effects.object_predicates` is itself a ``TargetFilter``,
  so ``IsCreature()`` / ``IsPlayer()`` / ``IsCreature() & IsTapped()``
  / ``HasSubtype("Sliver")`` all describe a target shape.
- :class:`OneOf` — a structural disjunction over filters. The "any
  target" target type expands to ``OneOf(IsCreature(),
  IsPlaneswalker(), IsBattle(), IsPlayer())``; a future "target
  artifact or creature" filter would be ``OneOf(IsArtifact(),
  IsCreature())``.

Composition rationale: ``ObjectPredicate``'s own ``|`` operator
returns ``ObjectOr``, which works fine for predicates that all run
on objects with a ``printing`` (a creature *or* an artifact, both
permanents). ``OneOf`` is a separate type because the "any target"
expansion mixes object-level predicates (``IsCreature``, …) with the
``IsPlayer`` predicate whose semantics is "this is a Player, not a
permanent" — it's still an ``ObjectPredicate`` and composable via
``|``, but flagging the structural disjunction explicitly with
``OneOf`` makes the target-grammar tree readable as a tree instead
of a chain of ``ObjectOr`` nodes, and gives tests / parsers a
concrete type to dispatch on.

A ``TargetFilter`` is *purely* a per-object predicate. Cross-target
constraints ("another target" / "different target") live on
:class:`mtg_bot.effects.targets.TargetSpec` as ``distinct_from``;
controller-relative constraints ("a creature an opponent controls",
"a creature you control") will compose at the filter level when the
parser introduces controller-aware atoms in a later PR — for now the
existing engine machinery handles those via per-effect overrides.
