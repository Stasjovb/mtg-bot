    If either slot has no legal candidates, ``legal_targets`` returns
    ``[]`` so the cast-time gate (``_targets_are_satisfiable``) refuses

    """Coordinated Clobbering ``{G}`` (Duskmourn): "Tap one or two
    target untapped creatures you control. They each deal damage
    equal to their power to target creature an opponent controls."

    Three slots, two slot kinds:

    - ``("creature", id)`` — the opp's creature taking damage (slot 0,
      mandatory)
    - ``("my_creature", id)`` — first friendly attacker (slot 1,
      mandatory)
    - ``("my_creature", id)`` — optional second friendly attacker
      (slot 2, beyond ``min_t``)

    Why opp first: the cast-pipeline target picker iterates slots in
    order. Putting the mandatory opp's-creature slot first and the
    optional second-friendly slot LAST lets ``min_t=2`` and
    ``max_t=3`` cleanly separate "must pick" (slots 0, 1) from
    "may pick" (slot 2), since the picker honors None-decline only
    for slot indices ``>= min_t``. The printed reading order ("tap
    one or two ..." first) is just oracle-text presentation and
    doesn't constrain MTG's target-picking sequence.

    Both friendly slots filter on currently-untapped (the
    "Tap [...] untapped creatures you control" gate) — a friendly
    creature already tapped is not a legal target. The ``my_`` prefix
    on the slot kind enforces controller==caster at pick time;
    ``"creature"`` for the opp slot enforces controller!=caster via
    a separate filter.

    Resolution mechanics:
    1. Tap each friendly target (idempotent; skips ones bounced /
       retargeted / already tapped between cast and resolve).
    2. Each surviving friendly creature deals ``effective_power``
       damage to the opp's creature target (read fresh per attacker
       so a dies-trigger between attackers reads post-death state
       correctly — though the opp creature is the SAME target).

    Mirrors ``DiplomaticRelationsEffect``'s two-slot skeleton with
    the ``min_t < max_t`` extension for the optional second attacker.

    Three-step single-resolve effect:

    1. Look at the top four cards of the controller's library.
    2. Agent picks one of those cards via ``choose_card_from_library``;
       it goes to hand. The other three go to the controller's
       graveyard.
    3. Controller gains 3 life.

    Mirrors ``LookAtTopTwoSplitHandGraveyard`` (Codecracker Hound's
    ETB) in shape — examine the top cards, split into hand/graveyard
    piles via the agent — but generalizes the 2-card split to a
    4-card hand-vs-graveyard distribution where exactly ONE card goes
    to hand and the rest to graveyard. A new bespoke class rather
    than parameterizing the existing one because:

    - the existing class's per-card surveil-vs-hand prompt has the
      agent decide each card individually (picking ``False`` means
      "this one to hand"; ``True`` means graveyard), with the
      asymmetric outcome of "exactly one to hand";
    - Commune with Evil's printed text reads as a single forced choice
      ("put one of them into your hand"), best modeled by
      ``choose_card_from_library`` (a single id-pick prompt) rather
      than four sequential surveil prompts;
    - the trailing ``You gain 3 life.`` rider is bundled into the
      same resolve step rather than a Sequence wrapper because the
      static side ships the spell as one engine class.

    Library < 4 cards: examines whatever's available (1, 2, or 3
    cards). With 0 cards left, the spell simply gains 3 life and
    no-ops the look. The chosen-to-hand card is the agent's pick (or
    the top card, when no agent is seated for unit tests / when the
    agent declines / picks an out-of-pool id). The remaining
    examined cards always go to graveyard regardless of count.

    """Haunted Screen's ``{7}: Put seven +1/+1 counters on this artifact.
    It becomes a 0/0 Spirit creature in addition to its other types.
    Activate only once.``

    The "Activate only once" rider is honored by the bespoke effect
    rather than by the legal/actions activation gate — the resolve site
    checks ``GameObject.has_activated_once_only_ability`` and silently
    no-ops if the flag is already set, then latches it on the FIRST
    successful resolve. The activator pays the {7} either way (the
    payment side is the legal-actions / activation pipeline's
    responsibility); the body's no-op ensures a wasted activation
    never re-applies the layer-4 type-change or stacks more counters.
    Same shape ``MonoistCircuitFeederETBEffect`` uses for ETB-only
    bookkeeping that survives a re-fire — the flag is checked-then-
    latched at the top of resolve.

    First-time resolve writes three permanent registry entries:

      - layer 4 ``add_type "creature"`` — read by ``is_creature_now``
        via the new ``GameObject.permanent_is_creature`` write-through
        cache. The cache survives cleanup (unlike ``temp_is_creature``)
        so the type-change persists across turns.
      - layer 4 ``add_subtype "Spirit"`` — read by
        ``effective_subtypes`` walking the registry.
      - layer 7 sublayer 1 ``set_base_pt (0, 0)`` — read by
        ``_compute_effective_pt`` via ``_registry_set_base_pt``.

    Plus seven +1/+1 counters via ``add_plus_one_counters`` (so a
    Loading Zone-style counter doubler upstream stacks correctly), and
    the ``has_activated_once_only_ability`` latch.
