"""Formula grammar — integer expressions evaluated at resolve time.

A ``Formula`` returns an ``int`` given the resolving game state and
the resolving controller. Effects that need a "where X is …" amount
that depends on runtime data (the mana value of a sacrificed
artifact, the power of a discarded creature, the number of cards in
a player's hand at resolve time, etc.) carry a ``Formula`` field
instead of a fixed ``int`` and call ``formula.value(state, controller_id)``
when they fire.

This module is deliberately small. The first concrete formula —
``MVOfCostPaidObjectPlus`` — reads the mana value of the first
GameObject in ``state.resolving_cost_paid_objects`` and adds a
constant. Future cards can compose new formulas (``PowerOfCostPaid
Object`` for "where X is the sacrificed creature's power",
``CountInZone(zone, predicate)`` for "where X is the number of
cards…", etc.) without disturbing the existing call sites.

Why a dedicated grammar rather than ``Condition.multiplier``: the
``Condition`` grammar is gated on a boolean ``matches`` and serves
cost-reduction rules; ``Formula`` is unconditional and serves
resolve-time amount calculation. Keeping them separate avoids
overloading either grammar with the other's semantics.
