"""Closed vocabularies of the string discriminants on card primitives.

Many parsed primitives carry a short string that their own code (or the
engine) dispatches on: ``RemoveTargetPermanents.action`` is ``"destroy"``,
``"exile"`` or ``"bounce"``; ``SearchLibrary.destination`` is one of four
zones; predicates name an event subject (``"attacker"``, ``"spell"``).
Each such field is typed with one of the ``StrEnum``s below and coerced
in its class's ``__post_init__``, so an unknown value is a construction
error rather than a silently ignored branch. A ``StrEnum`` member
compares and hashes equal to its value, so every existing ``== "exile"``
comparison and string-keyed lookup keeps working.

The members of each enum are the values the code gives meaning to
(collected from the dispatching code paths, not only from the values the
current card pools happen to use). Fields whose values come from an open
vocabulary stay ``str``: counter names (``"charge"``, ``"corpse"``),
subtypes, display labels, and target-kind tags (``"graveyard_creature"``,
``"my_creature"``), which form one engine-wide namespace shared by every
targeting effect.

Runtime game state keeps plain strings: an effect that copies one of
these values into a game record (a mana coin, a delayed trigger, a
continuous-effect kind) stores ``.value``.
