"""Dynamic power/toughness formulas -- the values of
``CardPrinting.dynamic_pt_formula``.

Every formula is a frozen dataclass deriving from :class:`PTFormula` and
answers ``base_pt(state, obj) -> (power, toughness)``, the creature's
base P/T before counters and other layer-7 modifications. The engine
reads it in ``game._dynamic_base_pt``; ``None`` on the printing means
"use the printed P/T".

They cover characteristic-defining abilities (CR 604.3, layer 7a:
Lhurgoyfs, Cosmogoyf, Harmonious Grovestrider, Territorial Kavu,
Adeline), leveler P/T (CR 711.2b, ``LevelerPT``) and Emissary Escort's
"+X/+0" rider, which the engine folds into the base P/T.

Formula classes that live next to their cards' other primitives also
derive from :class:`PTFormula`: ``cube_creatures_wg.PowerEqualsCount``,
``layout_effects.LevelerPT`` and ``roto_board.CardTypesInYourGraveyardPT``.
The card IR (``mtg_bot.cards.ir``) emits them like any other class.
