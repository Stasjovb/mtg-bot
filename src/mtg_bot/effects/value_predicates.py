"""Object predicates over an object's characteristic *values* — mana
value, color, and combined power/toughness — plus the bare
"permanent" atom.

Sibling of :mod:`mtg_bot.effects.object_predicates` (type / state /
controller atoms). Every class here is an ``ObjectPredicate`` and
therefore also a ``TargetFilter``, so the parser's target-phrase
grammar (:mod:`mtg_bot.cards.parser.target_phrases`) composes them
with the type atoms via ``&`` / ``|`` / ``~``:

- "nonland permanent with mana value 3 or less"
  -> ``IsPermanent() & ~IsLand() & HasManaValueAtMost(3)``
- "nonblack creature" -> ``IsCreature() & ~HasColor("B")``
- "creature with total power and toughness 5 or less"
  -> ``IsCreature() & HasTotalPowerAndToughnessAtMost(5)``

The predicates read characteristics from the object wherever it is
(battlefield permanent, spell on the stack, card in a graveyard), so
the same atoms serve counterspell filters ("target creature spell
with power or toughness 2 or less") and removal filters alike.
Players have no ``printing`` and evaluate ``False`` everywhere.
