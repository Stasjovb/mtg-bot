    Reads ``state.resolving_source`` for the permanent to sacrifice and
    schedules a delayed ``SacrificeSourceDelayed`` trigger keyed at the
    current turn — the same "next end step on the current turn"
    interpretation Devastating Onslaught uses for its haste-token sac
    scheduling and Attack-in-the-Box's "if you do, sacrifice it at the
    beginning of the next end step" rider.

    On resolve, ``state.delayed_triggers`` gains an entry with
    ``fire_at_turn = state.turn_number`` (the current turn's upcoming
    end step), ``controller_id`` set to the controller, and
    ``source_id`` set to ``state.resolving_source.id``. The standard
    ``run_delayed_end_step_triggers`` machinery then pushes a synthetic
    ``BEGINNING_OF_END_STEP`` trigger that fires
    ``SacrificeSourceDelayed`` against the same source.

    Returns ``True`` when the schedule lands; ``False`` when there's
    no resolving source (defensive — this should never happen at a
    real callsite, but keeps composition with ``IfYouDo`` honest).
