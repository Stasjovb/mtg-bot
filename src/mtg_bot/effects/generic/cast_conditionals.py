"""Resolution-time spell conditionals: "... instead if <condition>" /
"If <condition>, <effect>" riders whose condition is a fact about how
the spell was cast or about the game state.

- :class:`SpellWasKicked` — "If this spell was kicked" (reads
  ``state.resolving_kicked``).
- :class:`AlternativeCostWasPaid` — "If the {1}{B} cost was paid"
  (Baleful Mastery; reads ``state.resolving_alt_cost_paid``).
- :class:`PermanentLeftYourControlThisTurn` — Revolt: "if a permanent
  left the battlefield under your control this turn" (reads
  ``Player.permanent_left_battlefield_this_turn``).
- Delirium reuses :class:`mtg_bot.effects.conditions.DeliriumActive`.

They are consumed by the shared
:class:`mtg_bot.effects.combinators.IfConditionElse` (which also takes
``StatePredicate`` conditions such as Threshold's
``CardsInGraveyardAtLeast``).
