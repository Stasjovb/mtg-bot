"""Engine pieces for the cube creatures bucket: red / multicolor /
colorless creatures (PowerLSV cube).

Everything here is card-agnostic: each class models one printed shape
(a cost atom, a permission, an effect) that the oracle-text grammar in
:mod:`mtg_bot.cards.parser.creature_rmc_grammar` composes. Sections:

* **Cost atoms** carried on ``ActivationCost.extra_costs`` —
  ``SacrificePermanentsCost`` ("Sacrifice a Forest", "Sacrifice an
  artifact", "Sacrifice five Treasures"), ``RemoveCountersFromSelfCost``
  ("Remove a +1/+1 counter from this creature"),
  ``TapUntappedPermanentsCost`` ("Tap an untapped Rebel you control"),
  ``ExileSelfFromGraveyardCost`` ("Exile this card from your
  graveyard"). Each exposes ``payable`` / ``pay`` / ``describe``.
* **Exile play permissions** — ``ExilePlayPermission`` rides
  ``GameObject.exile_play_permission`` and is honored by
  ``legal_actions`` / ``_cast_spell`` / ``_play_land`` for cards in ANY
  player's exile (Ragavan casts the opponent's card).
