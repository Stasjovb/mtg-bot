"""Generic effects cluster module — graveyard-return primitives.

Houses the unified ``ReturnFromGraveyard`` base and its constructor-sugar
subclasses (the legacy ``Return*FromGraveyard*`` family). Each subclass
preserves its public name and constructor surface for parser-dispatch /
test stability; the base does the actual zone-walk + filter + move +
optional rider work.

Sibling cluster files for adjacent surface areas:
  * ``bounce.py`` — battlefield-to-hand bounces and the legacy bounce
    sugar classes (also re-exports several ``ReturnFromGraveyard``
    subclasses for cards whose printed text starts with "return" but
    whose engine semantics live here).
  * ``zone_moves.py`` — generic zone-to-zone primitives that don't
    fit the graveyard-return family.

# Unified ``ReturnFromGraveyard`` base.

# Replaces the bespoke recipe shared by the legacy
# ``Return*FromGraveyard*`` family: walk the controller's graveyard,
# filter cards by a card-type predicate (creature, artifact, land,
# nonland permanent, plus optional widening for enchantment /
# Spacecraft / artifact), optionally cap by mana value, pick up to N,
# move them to ``hand`` or ``battlefield``, and (optionally) apply a
# +1/+1 counter or enforce a sum-of-mana-value budget.
#
# Each legacy class survives as a thin sugar subclass that fixes the
# config in ``__post_init__``; this preserves their public name and
# constructor surface for parser-dispatch / test stability.

    Count axes:

      * ``min_n`` / ``max_n`` — range for the cast pipeline's target
        picker. ``max_n=1`` is a single-target effect.
      * ``max_total_mv`` — when > 0, enforces a SUM-of-mana-value

        Survivors). Picks past the budget are skipped with a log line.

        Battlefield destination routes through ``put_into_battlefield``
        so ETB triggers fire normally.

        (no targets selected; sweep every matching card). All other
        axes still apply (filter + move).

      * ``target_kind`` — the Target tuple's first slot
        (``"graveyard_creature"`` / ``"graveyard_artifact"`` /
        ``"graveyard_land"``); used both for legality emission and
