"""Effects and rules for the roto cards that change card types and colors
(CR 613 layers 4 and 5): Mycosynth Lattice, Liquimetal Coating, Unable to
Scream and Karn, the Great Creator.

The layered reads themselves live in :mod:`mtg_bot.game`
(``effective_card_types`` / ``has_card_type`` / ``is_artifact_now`` /
``effective_colors``); Lattice's statics are printing fields synthesized
there, and its mana rule is ``actions.mana_spendable_as_any_color``.
This module holds the one-shot effects that write layer-4 / layer-7
registry entries and the two hand / exile fetches. Design:
``docs/EFFECTIVE_CHARACTERISTICS_DESIGN.md``.
