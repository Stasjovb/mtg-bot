    """Magical Hack: 'Change the text of target spell or permanent
    by replacing all instances of one basic land type with another.'

    Implementation scope: targets a basic land on the battlefield.
    Picks the new basic land type via the controller's
    ``choose_mana_color`` callback, mapped W/U/B/R/G to
    Plains/Island/Swamp/Mountain/Forest. The OLD basic land type is
    derived automatically from the target's effective subtypes
    (basic lands typically have exactly one). Writes a layer-3
    ``"replace_basic_land_type"`` registry entry sourced by the
    resolving spell with ``params=(old, new)`` and
    ``expires_at=None`` — text changes persist indefinitely (CR
    612). The sorcery itself goes to graveyard, so the entry is
    never auto-dropped.

    Limitations: only handles basic-land-type substitution on basic
    lands. Real Magical Hack also rewrites rules text on non-basic
    permanents that mention basic land types (e.g., a creature with
    "Forestwalk"); this engine doesn't yet model landwalk so the
    extension is a no-op there.
