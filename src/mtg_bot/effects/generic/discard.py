    Variant of ``TargetOpponentDiscardsCasterChoice`` that honors the

    is OFFERED the directed discard rather than forced into it. Used
    by Cracked Skull's ETB. The reveal scope is ``look at`` (caster-
    only) rather than the public ``reveals their hand``, but the
    state-tracking primitive is the same: every card in the hand
    becomes ``publicly_known_to`` the caster (one-way reveal).

    Simplification vs. the printed ``target player`` scope on Cracked
    Skull: targets are restricted to opponents only (the same
    convention the original ``TargetOpponentDiscardsCasterChoice``
    rides). Self-targeting is never strategically correct for the
    controller, so the legality narrowing doesn't affect rational
    play; documented as the standard EoE / DSK target-player
    simplification.
