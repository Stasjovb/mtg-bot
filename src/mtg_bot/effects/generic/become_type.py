    """Source gains the listed card-types and/or subtypes, optionally with
    a new base P/T, IN ADDITION TO ITS OTHER TYPES.

    Always writes registry entries with ``expires_at=None`` (the entry
    persists until the source leaves play). Wrap with
    ``ApplyEffect(BecomeType(...), ends_at=<Duration>)`` to give the
    change a finite lifetime — ``ApplyEffect`` rewrites the lifetime
    fields of every entry written here.

    Registry writes (each gated on its parameter being non-empty):

      - For each entry in ``types_to_add``: layer 4 ``add_type``. When
        the type is ``"creature"``, also flips the
        ``GameObject.permanent_is_creature`` write-through cache that
        ``is_creature_now`` reads. ``run_cleanup_step`` rebuilds the
        cache from the registry after expiring cleanup-scoped entries,
        so an ``ApplyEffect``-wrapped ``BecomeType`` with a finite
        duration correctly reverts the cache when its entry expires.
      - For each entry in ``subtypes_to_add``: layer 4 ``add_subtype``.
        Read by ``effective_subtypes`` walking the registry, so any
        duration is faithfully respected.
      - When ``base_pt`` is set: layer 7 sublayer 1 ``set_base_pt``.
        Read by ``_compute_effective_pt`` via
        ``_registry_set_base_pt``, so any duration is faithfully
        respected.

    Target selection: when ``targets`` carries a ``(kind, id)`` pair,
    the registry entries target that object — the spell/ability source
    (``state.resolving_source``) is still recorded as the
    registry-entry ``source_id``, so the entry is dropped when the
    spell/ability source leaves play. With no targets, the effect
    falls back to self-target (Haunted Screen, manland animation):
    both ``source_id`` and ``target_id`` are
    ``state.resolving_source.id``.
