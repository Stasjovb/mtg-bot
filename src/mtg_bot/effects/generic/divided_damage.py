"""Divided damage: "<Name> deals N damage divided as you choose among any
number of target creatures" (Pyrokinesis, Fire Covenant) and "among up to
two target creatures and/or planeswalkers" (Shatterskull Smashing).

CR 601.2d: the division is announced while casting, after targets are
chosen — each target gets at least 1. ``actions._cast_spell`` asks the
effect for the total (``division_total``) and records the split on the
StackItem (``StackItem.division``); resolution reads it back through
``state.resolving_division``. Damage assigned to a target that is no
longer legal on resolution is simply not dealt.
