    The per-opponent loop walks each non-controller, non-eliminated
    player in turn order. The agent's ``choose_mode`` hook is presented
    only with the modes that are legal for that opponent at resolve time
    (sac is offered only when they control a nonland permanent; discard
    only when they have at least one card in hand; decline is always
    offered). Resolution branches:

    - **sac**: ``choose_sacrifice`` picks a victim from the legal nonland
      permanents, ``mtg_bot.turn.sacrifice`` fires the sac through the
      standard pipeline.
    - **discard**: ``choose_discard`` picks a hand card; the card moves
      to the graveyard and ``fire_opponent_discards_triggers`` fires.
    - **decline**: the opponent is recorded as non-compliant and takes
      damage at the end of the loop.

    A defensive missing-agent counts as decline (same as the bespoke
    behavior). The damage step uses ``_apply_damage`` so the source's
    lifelink keyword (Osseous Sticktwister has lifelink) interacts with
    the damage cleanly.

    damage to non-compliers; Osseous Sticktwister is the only EoE/DSK
