class FightTargetCreatureWithTargetCreature(Effect):
    """Bilateral fight effect: "Target creature you control fights
    target creature an opponent controls" (CR 701.12).

    Sibling of the Aura-shape ``EnchantedCreatureFightsTargetEffect``
    in ``effects/bespoke.py``: that class derives the source-side
    fighter from the resolving Aura's ``attached_to`` field; this
    generic class derives BOTH fighters from a deterministic battle-
    field scan that matches the Rust
    ``Effect::FightTargetCreatureWithTargetCreature`` arm
    (``rust/src/state_ops_resolve.rs``):

      * Source-side fighter = FIRST creature on the source-controller's
        battlefield (smallest list index).
      * Opponent-side fighter = FIRST creature on the opponent's
        battlefield (smallest list index).

    The deterministic-pick shape mirrors Rust's first-slice "no
    explicit target choice" convention (same pattern as
    ``Effect::PumpTargetCreatureUntilEOT`` and
    ``Effect::DealDamageAnyTarget``). The richer target-choice
    machinery (multi-slot ``targets`` tuple with ``ControlledByYou``
    and ``ControlledByOpponent`` filters, agent-driven push-time
    pick) is the future-slice extension once the cross-engine
    decision-callback substrate plumbs explicit target picks
    bilaterally.

    **Mechanism.** Compute BOTH fighters' effective power BEFORE
    applying any damage (CR 701.12 — simultaneous-damage event;
    a fighter that takes lethal still deals its damage first). If
    either fighter is missing at resolve time, the fight does NOT
    deal damage on either side (CR 701.12c — silent fizzle). Routes
    through ``_apply_damage`` so any "when ~ is dealt damage" auras
    on either fighter trigger correctly. State-based actions then
    handle creatures with lethal damage on the next SBA pass.

    **Consumer.** No real-EoE card uses this exact generic shape
    today — the only EoE Fight consumer (Meltstrider's Resolve) is
    Aura-shape and routes through
    ``EnchantedCreatureFightsTargetEffect``. This class exists as
    the Rust-side ``Effect::FightTargetCreatureWithTargetCreature``
    sibling so the bridge has a Python target for the new effect
    arm; synthetic probes drive end-to-end coverage. Future cards
    matching the bilateral generic-fight shape (Pounce, Prey Upon,
    Rabid Bite — none in EoE) drop in cleanly.

    **Deferred riders** (documented in
    ``docs/EOE_PROBE_READINESS_AUDIT.md``):
    - "Up to one target creature you control fights..." (optional
      target slot, no-fizzle on missing source-side).
    - "Target creature you control fights target creature... and
      gains trample / deathtouch UEOT" (composes via Sequence with
      a future Pump+Keyword arm).
    - "Target creature fights twice" (would need a counter or a
      sequence of two FightTarget arms).
    - The Aura-attached-creature shape (Meltstrider's Resolve) —
      kept on the bespoke ``EnchantedCreatureFightsTargetEffect``
      class until the Aura ETB-trigger substrate routes
      ``attached_to`` through the cross-engine bridge end-to-end.
