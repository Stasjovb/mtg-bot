    - Drops the real card's "Sacrifice a Spirit" cost.
    - Drops the "except it isn't a Spirit" rider on the resulting
      copy.
    - Activate-as-sorcery is moot because we ship as a sorcery

    slot 1 is the source whose printing is copied. The two must

class LockOrUnlockDoorOfTargetRoomYouControl(Effect):
    """Keys to the House: "Lock or unlock a door of target Room you
    control. Activate only as a sorcery."

    Resolves on a target Room permanent the controller controls. The
    controller chooses one of the Room's two doors to toggle (via
    ``choose_target`` over the legal-target pool — Rooms — and then
    ``choose_mode`` over a per-Room ``["lock <X>", "unlock <X>", ...]``
    label list). The chosen half flips its membership in
    ``GameObject.unlocked_halves``: a locked half being unlocked is
    added to the set; an unlocked half being locked is removed.

    The ``Activate only as a sorcery.`` rider is honored at the
    activated-ability level (``sorcery_speed=True``), not in the
    effect; the effect itself is happy to resolve at any point.

    Unlike the printed ``UnlockRoomHalf`` action (sorcery-speed special
    action that pays the half's mana cost), this effect skips the cost
    payment — the controller's "Keys" sacrifice already paid for the
    privilege. The unlock side-effects (Eerie observers, etc.) follow
    the same path the action takes: the predicate-style ENTERS event
    on a half-name filter does NOT re-fire here because the engine
    layer's ``_unlock_room_half_with_triggers`` is the canonical entry
    point. We mirror its observable state change (modify
    ``unlocked_halves``) without re-firing the per-half on-unlock
    triggered abilities — keeps the effect surgical.
