    """**Cross-engine bridge sibling of**
    :class:`PairedTargetPumpDebuffUEOT` **for Monoist Circuit-Feeder's
    ETB** — DETERMINISTIC first-creature pick, no agent target choice.

    Monoist Circuit-Feeder (real EoE card, 14,727 17lands decks):
    "When this creature enters, until end of turn, target creature you
    control gets +X/+0 and target creature an opponent controls gets
    -0/-X, where X is the number of artifacts you control."

    This class is the EXACT analogue of
    :class:`mtg_bot.effects.generic.damage.FightTargetCreatureWith
    TargetCreature` (the deterministic-pick Rust-unit-variant bridge
    sibling) vs the agent-driven
    :class:`mtg_bot.effects.bespoke...EnchantedCreatureFightsTarget
    Effect`. The real Monoist Circuit-Feeder printing parses (via
    ``cards/parser/effects.py``) to the AGENT-DRIVEN, two-REQUIRED-
    target :class:`PairedTargetPumpDebuffUEOT` (the controller freely
    picks ANY legal own creature + ANY legal opponent creature, CR
    601.2c). That class stays the real-card target. THIS class exists
    purely as the cross-engine bridge target for Rust's unit-variant
    ``Effect::TwoSubjectPumpAndDebuffByArtifactCount`` (which picks
    BOTH targets deterministically at apply time with no decision
    callback — the established campaign no-decision-callback
    convention, ``rust/src/state_ops_resolve.rs``).

    **Why NOT loader-admitted (§2).** Routing the real card's
    agent-driven targeting through this deterministic bridge in the
    production-deck loader would silently degrade free agent target
    choice to a fixed first-creature pick in multi-creature board
    states. Per the Fight precedent the deterministic sibling is NOT
    production-deck-loader-admitted; the genuine real-EoE probe drives
    the actual ``PairedTargetPumpDebuffUEOT`` constrained by a picker
    shim so the agent's two-target pick is forced to the FIRST own /
    FIRST opponent creature, byte-equal with this class's scan. See
    ``docs/SEARCH_LIMITATIONS.md``.

    **Mechanism (mirrors the Rust resolve arm BIT-FOR-BIT).**
      * ``x = sum(1 for o in state.battlefield if o.controller_id ==
        controller_id and o.printing.is_artifact)`` — the SAME
        artifact-count read :class:`DealDamageToOpponentCreatureBy
        ArtifactCount` uses (damage.py:445-448) and the SAME
        denominator the parser's ``CountControlledMatching(
        IsArtifact())`` formula computes.
      * ``x = max(0, x)``; if ``x <= 0`` → silent no-op (matches the
        Rust ``if x <= 0`` short-circuit and the round-32..49
        X-from-count zero convention).
      * Source-side target = FIRST creature ``o`` in
        ``state.battlefield`` insertion order with
        ``o.controller_id == controller_id`` (smallest list index —
        same scan :class:`FightTargetCreatureWithTargetCreature` and
        Rust's resolve use). If present → ``grant_pt_pump_ueot(power=
        x, toughness=0)``.
      * Opponent-side target = FIRST creature with
        ``o.controller_id != controller_id``. If present →
        ``grant_pt_pump_ueot(power=0, toughness=-x)``.
      * Per-side INDEPENDENT (CR 608.2c — two independent "target"
        clauses, NOT "up to one"): a missing side is a silent no-op
        and the other side still applies. Matches the Rust arm's
        per-side independence.

    End-of-turn cleanup is the standard layer-7 ``"pump_pt"``
    ``expires_at="cleanup"`` registry expiry (same path
    :class:`PumpTargetCreatureUntilEOT` / :class:`PairedTargetPump
    DebuffUEOT` use).

    Unit-shape ``@dataclass(frozen=True)`` with no constructor args
