    Generic primitive for the "draw X cards, where X is <count>" oracle

    ``CostReduction.condition`` uses): the resolve site reads
    ``condition.multiplier(state, controller_id)`` at fire time, which
    is the exact count semantics each ``Condition`` already encodes
    (``PerDifferentlyNamedLand`` counts distinctly-named lands the
    viewer controls, ``PerControlled`` counts permanents matching the
    inner ``ObjectPredicate``, etc.).

    The ``description`` argument is a short oracle-text fragment used
    by ``describe()`` so log output reads naturally — e.g. for
    ``PerDifferentlyNamedLand`` we want "draw X cards, where X is the
    number of differently named lands you control" rather than the
    generic ``Condition.__class__.__name__``. The fragment is parser-
    supplied (one per claimed phrase shape), keeping the runtime engine
    class oblivious to oracle-text wording while still producing
    readable logs.

    Replaces the bespoke ``AllFatesScrollDrawEffect`` for the
    differently-named-lands surface; reusable for any future "draw X
    where X is <Condition.multiplier>" printing without further engine
    work.
