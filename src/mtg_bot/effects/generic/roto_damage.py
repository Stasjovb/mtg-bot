"""Roto package P6: damage prevention and redirection (CR 615
prevention effects; redirection, CR 614.1 / 615).

Two rules-modifying effects ride the continuous-effects registry as
``layer=0`` entries (the ``cast_sorceries_as_flash`` precedent) that end
at cleanup (``expires_at="cleanup"``), so they survive their source
leaving the battlefield and are cloned / hashed with the rest of the
registry:

* ``PREVENT_COMBAT_TO_AND_BY`` (``target_id`` = a creature) -- "Prevent
  all combat damage that would be dealt to and dealt by <that creature>
  this turn." (Maze of Ith, Cephalid Illusionist).
* ``REDIRECT_NEXT_DAMAGE`` (``target_id`` = the protected creature,
  ``params=(n, redirect_to_id)``) -- "The next N damage that would be
  dealt to this creature this turn is dealt to target creature you
  control instead." (Nomads en-Kor). A shield, used up as damage is
  redirected; redirection isn't prevention, so it applies even to
  damage that can't be prevented.

And one printed static, held in ``CardPrinting.replacement_statics``:
:class:`PreventAllDamageToSelf` -- "Prevent all damage that would be
dealt to <this creature>." (Black Panther, Hope Enduring).

Damage is routed through these by two hooks: :func:`route_damage` at
the top of ``effects.base._apply_damage`` (noncombat damage) and
:func:`route_combat_damage_events` in ``combat._resolve_damage_step``.
Prevention applies first, then redirection; redirected damage is a
modified event that the new recipient's own prevention / shields apply
to in turn (CR 616.1, each shield at most once -- it's used up).
