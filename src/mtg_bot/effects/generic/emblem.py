"""Emblem substrate (CR 114) — the Tezzeret, Cruel Captain emblem's
begin-combat trigger body and the emblem that carries it.

An emblem is a command-zone object (``GameState.emblems``) created by a
"You get an emblem with '<abilities>'" effect (CR 113.1g / 114). It has
no characteristics other than its abilities (CR 114.3) and never leaves
the command zone (CR 114.5). We model an emblem as a synthetic
``GameObject`` whose ``printing`` is a ``make_emblem`` ``CardPrinting``
carrying the emblem's triggered abilities; the existing trigger-dispatch
machinery (extended to scan ``state.emblems`` as a source) and the
existing ``resolve_top_of_stack`` path then fire + resolve the emblem's
abilities exactly like a permanent's.

Emblems are created by ``cube_walkers.CreateEmblemWithAbilities``, which
carries the emblem's abilities inline. This module ships the body of the
one emblem the unified grammar can't parse -- Tezzeret, Cruel Captain's
−7 emblem: "At the beginning of combat on your turn, put three +1/+1
counters on target artifact you control. If it's not a creature, it
becomes a 0/0 Robot artifact creature." (:func:`tezzeret_cruel_captain_emblem`).

**Honest-stop (documented in docs/SEARCH_LIMITATIONS.md).** The
"becomes a 0/0 Robot artifact creature" half is a PERMANENT layer-4
type-set + layer-7b P/T-set continuous-effect animate and is NOT
modeled here — the emblem trigger body lands the three +1/+1 counters
on the target artifact (byte-equal cross-engine) and stops. See the
``TezzeretEmblemBeginCombat`` docstring for the precise remainder map.

    ``add_plus_one_counters`` (honoring the counter-doubling replacement
    + the counters-added observer trigger inside the helper).

    **What is HONEST-STOPPED (the becomes-Robot half).** "If it's not a
    creature, it becomes a 0/0 Robot artifact creature" is a PERMANENT
    (not UEOT) continuous effect: a layer-4 type-adding set (the
    artifact gains creature + the Robot creature type) plus a layer-7b
    P/T-set (0/0). Neither engine has a PERMANENT type+P/T-set animate on
    an artifact today — the existing animate substrate
    (``BecomeLandCreatureUEOT`` / Spacecraft "becomes a creature") is
    UEOT and land-shaped. Building it is its own layer-system slice; it
    is NOT taken here per the campaign honest-stop policy. See
    docs/SEARCH_LIMITATIONS.md for the precise layer map. The
    three-counter half alone is the byte-equal landing.
