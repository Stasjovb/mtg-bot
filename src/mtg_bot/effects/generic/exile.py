    """Generic "put one creature card exiled with this permanent onto the
    battlefield under your control with N additional +1/+1 counters"
    primitive.

    Walks every player's exile zone for cards tagged with
    ``GameObject.exiled_by_source == state.resolving_source.id`` filtered
    to creature cards (``printing.is_creature``), asks the resolving
    controller's agent to pick ONE via ``choose_target`` (the natural
    "pick one from a list of GameObject ids" prompt — re-used for non-
    spell choices the same way ``choose_sacrifice`` is re-used elsewhere),
    pulls it out of exile, and brings it onto the controller's
    battlefield via ``put_into_battlefield`` (so ETBs fire normally) with
    ``counter_amount`` extra +1/+1 counters added on top of whatever the
    creature's printed body would otherwise place.

    Differs from ``PutEachCreatureCardExiledWithSourceOntoBattlefield
    UnderYourControl`` (which recalls every tagged creature) in two
    ways: (a) only ONE card is recalled, picked by the controller; and
    (b) the recalled creature gets +N +1/+1 counters added at ETB time.
    Matches Sothera, the Supervoid's end-step recall surface verbatim.

    The ``exiled_by_source`` linkage is cleared on the recalled card so
    a future leave-the-battlefield event on the source doesn't try to
    release it again. Other tagged cards remain in exile with their
    linkage intact (so a sibling ability — none in the EoE pool today,
    but the contract is honest — could still find them).

    No-op (no log spam, no error) when ``state.resolving_source`` is
    None, when no tagged creature card exists in any exile zone, or
    when the resolving controller has no agent (defensive — every
    real game seat has one).

class SacrificeSelfPreservingExileLink(Effect):
    """Sacrifice this permanent, suppressing the on-leave auto-return of
    cards still tagged ``exiled_by_source = source.id``.

    Companion to ``ReanimateOneExiledWithSourceWithCounters``: Sothera,
    the Supervoid's printed end-step body says "sacrifice Sothera, then
    put a creature card exiled with it onto the battlefield...". A
    naive Sequence(SacrificeSelf, recall) would lose the source link —
    the engine's ``_release_exiled_until_leaves`` hook fires the moment
    Sothera leaves the battlefield, racing every tagged card back to
    its owner's battlefield BEFORE the recall step gets to read the
    exile zone. The engine-level fix is to invert the order at
    composition time (recall first, sac second) AND suppress the
    on-leave hook so the OTHER tagged cards (the ones not picked by the
    recall) don't race back either — the printed text doesn't say they
    should.

    The suppression flag ``state.suppress_exiled_by_source_on_leave_for``
    is one-shot: this effect sets it to the source's id immediately
    before sacrificing; ``_release_exiled_until_leaves`` clears the flag
    the first time it observes the matching source-id leave event and
    skips its auto-return loop for that one event. Subsequent leave
    events for the same source (impossible after a sac, but the contract
    is local) would auto-return any cards still linked, so the
    suppression's blast radius is exactly one leave event.

    No-op when ``state.resolving_source`` is None or the source has
    already left the battlefield (e.g. an earlier sequence step
    destroyed it — defensive; Sothera's body never composes with such
    a step today).
