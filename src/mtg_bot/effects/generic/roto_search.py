"""Library-search hooks for the Vintage Roto P2 package (F18: Opposition
Agent, Wan Shi Tong, Librarian, Archive Trap).

Every effect that searches a library wraps its ``resolve`` with
:func:`library_search` (the searcher is the resolving controller) and
calls :func:`searched_card_taken` for each card it finds, right after
taking it out of the library and before moving it anywhere. The hooks:

* record ``Player.library_searched_turn`` ("if an opponent searched their
  library this turn" -- Archive Trap's alternative cost);
* while an opponent of the searcher controls an Opposition Agent, swap
  the searcher's agent for one whose search picks
  (``choose_card_from_library``) are made by that opponent ("You control
  your opponents while they're searching their libraries"), and exile
  each found card with a play permission for that opponent ("they exile
  each card they find. You may play those cards for as long as they
  remain exiled, and you may spend mana as though it were mana of any
  color to cast them");
* after the search, put "whenever an opponent searches their library"
  triggers on the stack (Wan Shi Tong).

Kept free of module-level engine imports so the base search modules can
import it at load time without an import cycle.
