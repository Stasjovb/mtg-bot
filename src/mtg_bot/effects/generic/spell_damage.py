"""Damage variants for spells: X damage and damage with a "dies this
turn -> exile instead" rider.

- :class:`DealXDamage` — "<Name> deals X damage to <target>" where X is
  the resolving spell's X (Traumatic Critique).
- :class:`DealDamageExileIfDiesThisTurn` — "<Name> deals N damage to
  target creature. If that creature would die this turn, exile it
  instead." (Suplex mode 1): marks the target
  (``GameObject.exile_if_dies_this_turn``, consumed by
  ``turn.move_off_battlefield``) and then deals the damage.
- :class:`DealDamagePaidInEnergy` — "Choose target <np>. You get
  {E}{E}{E}, then you may pay any amount of {E}. <Name> deals that much
  damage to that permanent." (Galvanic Discharge).
