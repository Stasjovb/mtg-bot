    attach this Equipment to that creature."``. "That creature" refers

    ``ManifestDreadThenPutPlusOneCountersOnIt`` resolves), so the
    Equipment auto-attaches without a printed-target choice — no
    ``requires_target`` machinery needed.

    Implementation parallels ``ManifestDreadThenPutPlusOneCountersOnIt``:
    snapshot the battlefield ids before manifesting, run
    ``ManifestDread(count=1)``, then identify the new face-down
    permanent by id-set difference. With fewer than two cards left in
    the library, ``ManifestDread`` may manifest one or zero cards —
    the attach step then either lands on the lone manifested face-down
    (one new id) or no-ops (no new id, Equipment stays unattached).
    No-ops if the source isn't an Equipment (defensive — only Equipment
    builds wire this engine class today).

    **First-slice deterministic shortcut: keep all on top.** Mirrors the
    Rust ``Effect::ScryN`` resolve arm in
    ``rust/src/state_ops_resolve.rs:1777-1792`` which inlines the same
    keep-all-on-top semantic without invoking the round-4 ``apply_scry``
    primitive. This satisfies "scry happened" semantics without
    requiring a decision callback to choose which cards go to the
    bottom; a future slice that plumbs a real "which to bottom"
    decision surface (sister to ``choose_surveil``, e.g.
    ``choose_scry_to_bottom``) can grow the resolve body without
    breaking the class shape.

    Keep-on-top is mechanically a no-op on the library (no zone moves,
    no order change), so resolution mutates only the log. This matches
    Rust's behavior bit-for-bit on the cross-engine bridge.

    Sister effect to :class:`Surveil` — same look-at-top-N pattern,
    differs in destination zone for the chosen cards (library bottom
    for scry vs graveyard for surveil).

    **Negative ``amount`` raises** loudly (CR 701.18 doesn't define
    Scry -1; surface it as a schema error). Matches Rust's
    ``ScryN count must be non-negative`` raise.

    **count > library size** clamps to library length per CR 701.18d
