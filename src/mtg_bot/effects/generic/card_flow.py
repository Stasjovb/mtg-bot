"""Card-flow effects: targeted draw, tutors, hand disruption, library
look-and-select, wheels, and mass zone moves.

Generic primitives introduced for the PowerLSV cube's "spells B" bucket
(Ancestral Recall, Demonic Tutor, Thoughtseize, Brainstorm, Stock Up,
Timetwister, Wheel of Fortune, Upheaval, ...). Every effect here is
parameterized by a small :class:`CardFilter` (printed characteristics of
a card in a hidden zone or graveyard) and / or a
:class:`mtg_bot.effects.formulas.Formula` amount, so one class covers a
whole printed shape rather than one card.

Decision hooks reuse the existing agent protocol (no new hook):

* tutor / look-at-top picks -> ``choose_card_from_library``
* caster's pick from a revealed hand -> ``choose_card_from_opponent_hand``
* "put a card from your hand on top" (Brainstorm) -> ``choose_discard``
  (the same "which hand card do I give up" decision surface)
* optional riders -> ``choose_yes_no``

Copy-on-write discipline (see ``game._CowList``): every site that moves a
card out of a library / graveyard / exile list removes it from the list
(a list mutator, which forks the share group) BEFORE mutating the card
object, so sibling search states never observe the mutation.
