"""Card types of cards outside the battlefield and the stack -- the one
shared definition behind every "card types among cards in <zone>" count.

Consumers: Delirium (``state_predicates.Delirium`` for trigger gates,
``conditions.DeliriumActive`` for statics / spell riders / activation
restrictions -- both delegate to :func:`delirium_active`), the
Lhurgoyfs' dynamic P/T (Pyrogoyf, Barrowgoyf), Ursine Monstrosity's
pump, Keen-Eyed Curator's exile count, Occult Epiphany's token count
and Atraxa, Grand Unifier's one-per-type pick.

Rules encoded here (the per-card helpers these replace each got some of
them wrong or left them out):

* CR 205.2a -- the card types are artifact, battle, creature,
  enchantment, instant, kindred, land, planeswalker and sorcery.
  Supertypes (legendary, basic, snow) and subtypes never count. The
  pre-2024 name of kindred, "Tribal", is folded into ``"Kindred"`` so
  an old-wording type line counts as the same type.
* CR 709.4 -- a split card outside the stack has the combined
  characteristics of both halves, so Commit // Memory contributes
  instant AND sorcery.
* CR 712.8a -- a double-faced card (transforming or modal) outside the
  battlefield and stack has only its front face's characteristics:
  Shatterskull Smashing in a graveyard is a sorcery card, not a land.
  The engine turns such cards front-face up as they leave the
  battlefield / stack (``game.restore_mdfc_front``); reading the
  snapshot here as well keeps the count right even on a zone move that
  forgot to restore it.
* CR 715.4 -- an adventurer card outside the stack has only its normal
  characteristics (Brazen Borrower in a graveyard is a creature card).
* Tokens and copies of spells are not cards (CR 108.2, 707.10a); the
  engine never leaves them in a graveyard / exile, and they are skipped
  here regardless.

The count is always taken from the zone's current contents at the
moment the caller asks, so statics see it continuously and spells /
abilities see it as they resolve.
