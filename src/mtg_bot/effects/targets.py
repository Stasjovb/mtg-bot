"""Target-spec grammar — per-effect target slots and back-references.

An :class:`mtg_bot.effects.base.Effect` carries its target shape on a
``targets: tuple[TargetSlot, ...]`` field. Each ``TargetSlot`` is
either:

- :class:`TargetSpec` — a fresh target prompt: filter + count range
  + cross-slot distinctness. The caster picks one or more legal
  targets satisfying the filter at cast time; legality is re-checked
  at resolve time per CR 608.2b.
- :class:`SlotRef` — a back-reference to an *earlier* slot's resolved
  target. Models pronouns like "that creature" in the second/third
  effect of a many-effects-one-target sequence (Sparkmage's Gambit:
  "deal 4 damage to target creature. Tap that creature. It doesn't
  untap during its controller's next untap step."). A ``SlotRef`` is
  *not* a target choice — it inherits its parent slot's resolved
  object and its parent slot's legality.

Slot indices are 0-based and scoped to **one EffectSequence** —
modes of a modal effect get their own scope, so ``SlotRef(0)``
inside mode B refers to mode B's slot 0, not the outer sequence's
slot 0.

Resolution semantics (CR 608 / CR 115.7):

- Number of targets the spell has, for legality, equals the number
  of ``TargetSpec``s across the spell's effects (across selected
  modes for a modal). ``SlotRef``s do not count.
- At resolve time each ``TargetSpec`` re-checks legality against
  the current battlefield state. An effect whose ``TargetSpec`` is
  illegal skips. An effect whose ``SlotRef``'s parent slot is
  illegal also skips.
- ``distinct_from`` is enforced at *selection time*: the targeting
  pipeline filters the candidate pool to exclude already-picked
  targets from the listed prior slot indices. CR 115.6's
  "different target" rule lives here.

Modal cards layer on top via
:class:`mtg_bot.effects.base.ModalEffect`, whose modes are each a
fresh ``EffectSequence`` with its own slot scope.
