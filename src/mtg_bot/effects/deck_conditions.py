"""Companion (CR 702.139) and the deck conditions it names.

Companion is a keyword ability that functions outside the game, written
"Companion — [Condition]." (CR 702.139a). Before the game, a player may
reveal one card they own from outside the game (their sideboard, CR
400.11a) with a companion ability whose condition their starting deck
fulfills (CR 103.2b); "starting deck" is the deck after the sideboard is
set aside (CR 103.2a, 702.139b). Once during the game, any time they have
priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, they
may pay {3} and put that card into their hand: a special action (CR
116.2g). The {3} is a rule, not part of the printed condition, so the IR
carries only the condition.

A :class:`DeckCondition` is a structured condition over the cards of a
starting deck. The two shapes here cover the cube's companions and leave
room for others (Gyruda, Keruga, Obosh, Kaheera: :class:`EachCardInStartingDeck`
with another pair of predicates; Umori, Yorion, Jegantha would add a
class each):

* :class:`EachCardInStartingDeck` - "Each <cards> in your starting deck
  <must>": Lurrus of the Dream-Den (each permanent card has mana value 2
  or less), Zirda, the Dawnwaker (each permanent card has an activated
  ability).
* :class:`StartingDeckDifferentNames` - "Each <cards> in your starting
  deck has a different name": Lutri, the Spellchaser (nonland cards).

The Python engine does not play companions: ``CardPrinting.companion``
is data for the card IR (the Rust engine in mtg-zero implements the
rules); no game code reads it. :meth:`DeckCondition.fulfilled_by` is the
reference check over a deck's ``GameObject`` s (cards in a library, whose
characteristics are their printed ones).
