"""Duration value types for continuous effects.

Each ``Duration`` translates to the ``(expires_at, expires_at_player_id)``
pair stored on a ``ContinuousEffect`` registry entry. Use them with the
``ApplyEffect(inner, ends_at=...)`` combinator (see ``combinators.py``)
to wrap an inner ``Effect`` and rewrite the lifetime of every registry
entry the inner adds.

All four finite durations are wired end-to-end:

- ``EndOfTurn`` (``"cleanup"``) — dropped at the active player's
  cleanup step in ``run_cleanup_step``.
- ``EndOfYourNextTurn`` (``"controller_untap"`` keyed on the
  controller) — dropped at the controller's next untap step in
  ``run_untap_step``. Exercised end-to-end by
  ``PumpCreaturesOpponentsControlUntilEOT``'s
  ``until_caster_next_turn=True`` keyword path.
- ``EndOfCombat`` (``"end_of_combat"``) — dropped at the
  end-of-combat step in ``clear_combat_state`` (combat.py). No
  production card uses this duration today; the wiring is in place
  so a future card can route through ``ApplyEffect(<inner>,
  EndOfCombat())`` without further plumbing.
- ``Permanent`` (``None``) — stays in the registry until the source
  leaves play (per ``move_off_battlefield``).

``UntilSourceLeaves`` is currently an alias for ``Permanent`` — see
its class docstring for when to differentiate.
