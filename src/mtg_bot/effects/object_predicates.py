"""Object-tier predicates: pure boolean tests over a single
``GameObject``.

This module is the bottom layer of the two-tier predicate stack. An
``ObjectPredicate`` is slot-agnostic — it doesn't know about subject
slots, source objects, or trigger dispatch. It just answers
"does this object satisfy the property?" given the object and the
current ``GameState`` (the state is needed for runtime-keyword and
runtime-power lookups that consult layers/grants).

The trigger-combinator layer in :mod:`mtg_bot.effects.predicates`
wraps these atoms with ``Subject(slot, inner)`` and ``Source(inner)``
to bind them to a specific subject slot or to the source object.

Composition: ``&`` / ``|`` / ``~`` build object-level And/Or/Not
combinators. The resulting trees are themselves ``ObjectPredicate``s
and can be wrapped by ``Subject`` / ``Source`` exactly like the atoms.
