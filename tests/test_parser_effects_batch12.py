"""Tests for batch-12 unified-effect-grammar additions:

* ``counter target artifact or enchantment spell`` —
  ``CounterTargetSpell(filter_types=frozenset({"Artifact", "Enchantment"}))``.
  More-specific shape that wins over the bare ``counter target spell``
  regex.
* ``exile all creatures and Spacecraft`` —
  ``ExileAllCreaturesAndSpacecraft()`` mass wrath. The capital ``S`` on
  Spacecraft is preserved verbatim from oracle text since the
  normalization layer only lowercases the first letter of the phrase.
* ``deals N damage to each opponent`` —
  ``DealDamageEachOpponent(amount=N)`` mass-burn. Used in modal-spell
  modes (Ruinous Rampage's burn half).
* ``exile all artifacts with mana value N or less`` —
  ``ExileAllArtifactsWithManaValueAtMost(max_mv=N)`` mass-artifact-exile
  (Ruinous Rampage's anti-artifact half).
* ``search your library for an artifact card, reveal it, put it into
  your hand, then shuffle`` —
  ``SearchLibraryForCard(filter_name="artifact", may_fail=True)``
  artifact tutor (Scour for Scrap mode 1).

Each new effect is exercised three ways: directly via ``_parse_effect``
on the normalized phrase, via ``_parse_effect_phrase`` (creature-trigger
surface form), and via ``_parse_spell_effect_phrase`` (spell sentence
form, capitalized first letter and trailing period). Negative cases
verify the regex stays narrow.

Card-claim tests confirm the parser end-to-end-claims the four EoE
cards unlocked by this batch (Annul, Beyond the Quiet, Ruinous Rampage,
Scour for Scrap).
