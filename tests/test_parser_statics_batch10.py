"""Batch 10: ``it's your turn`` static-ability condition.

Adds ``it's your turn`` → ``active_turn_only=True`` to the
``_STATIC_CONDITION_KWARGS`` phrasebook so static-ability lines like
``As long as it's your turn, this creature gets +N/+N.`` (and the
trailing-shape sibling) parse into a ``StaticAbility`` with the
``active_turn_only`` engine gate set.

The engine gate already exists (Memorial Team Leader uses it via the
hand-built ``During your turn`` rider on an anthem scope), so this batch
is forward-looking grammar coverage for the ``As long as`` surface
form. No new EoE creature unlocks today — the only EoE oracle text in
the leading/trailing static shape uses the two pre-existing conditions
(``you control an artifact`` and ``you've cast two or more spells this
turn``). Adding the phrase keeps the parser ready for reprints / future
sets without lying about engine semantics.
