"""Parser support for colorless utility lands.

The colorless-utility-land branch matches plain ``Land`` cards (no
supertypes, no subtypes) whose first oracle line is exactly
``"{T}: Add {C}."``.

  * **Single-line** (only ``{T}: Add {C}.``) → the historical
    ``make_colorless_land`` simplification (no abilities, generic-only).
  * **Multi-line** (Secluded Starforge — ``{T}: Add {C}.`` plus a
    ``Tap X untapped artifacts → +X/+0`` pump and a ``{5},{T}: Create a
    Robot token`` ability) → the FULL faithful printing: every line is
    routed through the activated-ability grammar and the land is built
    via ``make_utility_land`` with all parsed AAs. NO trailing-AA drop
    (was the prior simplification, now superseded by the tap-X-artifacts
    X-channel substrate — see ``tests/test_secluded_starforge_parity.py``).

Other utility lands (Command Bridge — ETB sac-self trigger + any-color
mana ability) are out of scope this batch and remain skipped.
