"""Tests for the DSK basic-landcycling printing-level keyword.

The DSK landcycling cycle (Plains/Island/Swamp/Mountain/Forest, all
``{2}`` cost) prints on five large creatures — Shepherding Spirits W,
Daggermaw Megalodon U, Spectral Snatcher B, Bedhead Beastie R,
Slavering Branchsnapper G. Each creature is otherwise a vanilla
keyword body (Flying / Vigilance / Ward—Discard / Menace / Trample)
plus the matching basic-landcycling line. This batch lands the
parser/printing plumbing:

- ``CardPrinting.landcycling: tuple[str, str] | None`` — declarative
  ``(land_subtype, mana_cost_str)`` field. Today this is *purely*
  declarative metadata: the engine does not yet enumerate hand-
  activated abilities, so the cycling cost cannot actually be paid in
  simulation. The field is populated honestly so the printing reflects
  oracle text, and a future activation pipeline (``legal_actions``
  enumeration of from-hand activations + an ``ActivationCost.discard_
  self`` cost atom) consumes the same field without having to re-walk
  the oracle text.
- ``_parse_landcycling_line(line)`` — printing-keywords recognizer
  that matches ``<Land>cycling {cost}`` for each of the five basic-
  land subtypes. Returns ``(subtype, cost_str)`` or ``None``.
- Creature-builder wiring: a recognized landcycling line populates
  the ``landcycling`` kwarg on ``make_creature`` and the line is
  consumed (continued past) so the rest of the clause grammar
  doesn't see it.

The five DSK creatures listed above each carry exactly one
non-landcycling line that already parses through the existing
keyword grammar (Flying / Vigilance / Trample / Menace) or the
em-dash ward-discard recognizer (Ward—Discard a card.) — adding the
landcycling recognizer is the only piece needed for end-to-end
parser claims on this batch.
