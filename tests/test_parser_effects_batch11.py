"""Tests for batch-11 unified-effect-grammar additions:

* ``target creature [you control] gets +N/+M and gains <kw>[ and <kw2>...]
  until end of turn`` — pump + grant-keywords compound that produces
  ``PumpTargetCreatureUntilEOT(power_bonus, toughness_bonus,
  granted_keywords, you_control_only)``.
* ``you may discard a card. If you do, draw N cards`` —
  ``OptionalDiscardCardThenDrawN(amount=N)`` wrapper. Singular ``draw a
  card`` and spelled-out small cardinals supported.
* ``you may sacrifice another creature or artifact. If you do, this
  creature gets +N/+M until end of turn`` — specialized self-pump
  wrapper ``OptionalSacAnotherForPumpSelfUEOT(power_bonus,
  toughness_bonus)``.
* ``you may sacrifice another creature or artifact. If you do,
  <inner-effect>`` — generic ``OptionalSacAnotherForEffect(inner_effect=
  ...)`` wrapper. Inner phrase parsed recursively via the unified
  grammar.

Each new effect is exercised three ways: directly via ``_parse_effect``
on the normalized phrase, via ``_parse_effect_phrase`` (creature-trigger
surface form), and via ``_parse_spell_effect_phrase`` (spell sentence
form, capitalized first letter and trailing period). This three-way
coverage verifies a single grammar addition lights up both contexts.

A claim test confirms the parser end-to-end-claims the four EoE cards
unlocked by this batch (Rig for War, Dark Endurance, Comet Crawler,
Swarm Culler, Kavaron Turbodrone).
