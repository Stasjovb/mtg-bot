"""Tests for the anthem-shape static-ability grammar.

The static-ability parser also handles permanents whose static abilities
target *other* creatures (not the source itself). The recognized surface
shapes are:

* ``Creatures you control get +N/+M[ and have <keyword>].``
* ``Other creatures you control get +N/+M[ and have <keyword>].``
* ``Creatures you control have <keyword>.``
* ``Other creatures you control have <keyword>.``
* Any of the above prefixed with ``During your turn, `` to set the
  ``active_turn_only`` flag (Memorial Team Leader's surface shape).

The new EoE card unlocked end-to-end by this grammar is **Memorial
Team Leader** (``During your turn, other creatures you control get
+1/+0.``). Tannuk, Steadfast Second is in the same family but has an
unmodeled ``Artifact cards and red creature cards in your hand have
warp {2}{R}.`` second clause that the parser deliberately can't claim,
so the structural-parity gate skips it; that's covered by an explicit
negative test below.

PR D continuous-effects shape (full anthem migration): the parser now
returns a ``tuple[StaticAbility, ...]``. Pure P/T anthems produce a
1-tuple carrying a layer-7c ``ContinuousModifier(PowerToughnessBonus)``;
single-keyword anthems produce a 1-tuple carrying a layer-6
``ContinuousModifier(GrantKeyword)``; multi-keyword and compound
P/T+keyword anthems fan out into multiple instances. The legacy
``granted_keywords`` field is empty on migrated statics.
