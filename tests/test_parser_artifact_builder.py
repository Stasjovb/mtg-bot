"""Parser support for pure-Artifact (non-Creature, non-Equipment, non-
Spacecraft) cards.

The first artifact shape the parser claims is the simplest end-to-end
Edge of Eternities pattern: a typed-self ETB trigger plus a printed
activated ability, both of which the unified ``_parse_clause``
orchestrator already recognizes. Melded Moxite is the only EoE
pure-artifact whose oracle text fits end-to-end today; every other
pure artifact carries a custom effect (Pinnacle Starcage, Requiem
Monolith, Memorial Vault, All-Fates Scroll, The Endstone, Thrumming
Hivepool) or a grammar shape outside the unified parser
(Cryogen Relic's "enters or leaves" composite trigger, Nutrient
Block's "is put into a graveyard" zone-change trigger,
Dubious Delicacy's negative-pump ETB).
