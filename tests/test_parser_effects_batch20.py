"""Tests for batch-20 effect-grammar and whole-spell additions.

One effect-grammar primitive lands in this batch:

* ``double the power of target creature you control until end of
  turn`` → ``DoubleTargetCreaturesPowerUEOT()``. Mightform
  Harmonizer's landfall trigger body. Distinct from the existing
  ``gets +N/+0`` UEOT pump shapes — the bonus is computed at
  resolve time from the target's current effective power rather
  than being a fixed constant. The engine class adds the
  measured-at-resolve power as a temp_power_bonus that clears at
  end-of-turn cleanup.

One creature newly claims through this primitive:

* **Mightform Harmonizer** — ``Landfall — Whenever a land you
  control enters, double the power of target creature you control
  until end of turn.`` The ability-word strip and landfall trigger
  predicate already existed; the only blocker was the
  unrecognized inner-effect grammar.

One whole-spell exact-text dispatch entry also lands in this batch
(see ``_WHOLE_SPELL_EXACT_TEXT`` in ``parser.spell_builder``):

* **Scrounge for Eternity** ``{2}{B}`` Sorcery — additional-cost
  sacrifice + ``Return target creature or Spacecraft card with mana
  value 5 or less from your graveyard to the battlefield. Then
  create a Lander token.`` The static drops the target-type
  widening, the mana-value cap, and the Lander rider; ships
  ``ReturnCreatureFromYourGraveyardToBattlefield()`` plus the
  ``additional_cost_sacrifice_creature_or_artifact=True`` printing
  flag (the latter wired separately via
  ``_detect_additional_cost_flags``). Per the parser-is-right rule
  (codified in batch 19), the parser claims a deliberately-
  simplified spell only when the printed effect's intent survives
  the simplification — Scrounge's base mechanic ("a graveyard
  return") survives, so the whole-spell tier matches; Pull Through
  the Weft stays unclaimed because the static replaces its composite
  with an effect of a different intent. Terminal Velocity was previously
  in this category but has since been claimed via ``TerminalVelocityEffect()``
  (bespoke-spells5) — the new engine class faithfully models all three
  printed sub-effects.

The shared parametrized parity test in ``tests/test_parser_parity.py``
enforces full ``CardPrinting`` parity, so this file focuses on the
new grammar / dispatch entries in isolation plus the claim
assertions.

# recognizer in ``effects.py`` claims the reanimation clause (returning

# both. This is MORE faithful than the previous simplification (which
