"""Tests for the trailing-shape ``As long as`` static-ability grammar.

The static-ability parser supports two surface forms of the same
semantics:

* **Leading**: ``As long as <condition>, this creature gets +N/+N[ and
  has <keyword>].``
* **Trailing**: ``This creature gets +N/+N[ and has <keyword>] as long
  as <condition>.``

The trailing shape unlocks Brightspear Zealot in EoE, whose oracle
text reads ``Vigilance\\nThis creature gets +2/+0 as long as you've
cast two or more spells this turn.``. Both shapes route through the
same condition phrasebook and must produce identical ``StaticAbility``
outputs for the same condition.
