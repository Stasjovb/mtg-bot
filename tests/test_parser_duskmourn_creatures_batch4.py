"""Tests for the fourth Duskmourn creature parser batch.

This batch grows the parser to claim a new cluster of Duskmourn
creatures by layering small additive primitives on top of the existing
engine surface — no new events or core data fields are required beyond
two trailing-rider gates on ``StaticAbility``.

* **``requires_delirium`` static gate** + **static ability-word prefix
  stripper** — Wildfire Wickerfolk (``{R}{G}`` 3/2 Artifact Creature —
  Scarecrow). Prints ``Haste`` plus
  ``Delirium — This creature gets +1/+1 and has trample as long as
  there are four or more card types among cards in your graveyard.``
  The ``Delirium —`` prefix carries no rules consequence (CR 207.2c)
  so the new ``_strip_static_ability_word_prefix`` helper drops it
  before the trailing static grammar dispatches; the ``as long as``
  tail then maps to ``requires_delirium=True`` via a new
  ``_STATIC_CONDITION_KWARGS`` entry. The engine's
  ``StaticAbility.applies_to`` evaluates the gate by walking the
  controller's graveyard and counting distinct card types — same
  semantics as the trigger-side ``StateBound(Delirium())`` predicate.
