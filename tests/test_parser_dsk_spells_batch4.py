"""Tests for the Duskmourn spells / enchantments / equipment / artifacts
batch-4 parser additions.

Each commit in this batch lands one card via a small additive change:
a literal-line entry on an existing builder, a name-keyed dispatch
factory on an existing builder, or a small flag widening on an existing
engine class. No new bespoke engine classes are introduced beyond the
manifest-dread-then-attach combinator described below.

New ``make_enchantment`` kwarg:

* ``ward`` (e.g. ``"{2}"``) — wires the printed Ward keyword on a non-
  Aura Enchantment ITSELF. Mirrors the same-named kwarg on
  ``make_creature`` and routes through the same
  ``CardPrinting.ward_cost`` / ``ward_cost_str`` fields the engine's
  ward-check helpers already read. Auras keep their own
  ``attached_grants_ward`` kwarg for the "Enchanted permanent has
  ward" rider — the two kwargs stay distinct because the Aura form
  targets the enchanted permanent, not the Aura itself.

New literal ETB line on the equipment_builder:

* ``"When this Equipment enters, manifest dread, then attach this
  Equipment to that creature."`` (Conductive Machete / Killer's Mask
  / Cursed Windbreaker DSK Equipment family) — wires the new
  ``ManifestDreadThenAttachSelf`` engine class which manifests the
  top-of-library card face-down (CR 701.55 / 701.34) and immediately
  attaches the Equipment to the just-manifested 2/2. Distinct from
  ``CreateTokenAndAttachSelf`` because the manifested permanent is a
  face-down card from library, not a freshly minted token. Parallels
  ``ManifestDreadThenPutPlusOneCountersOnIt`` (Slimy Aquarium /
  Weight Room door triggers) — same back-reference shape on "that
  creature" pointing at the just-manifested face-down.

Cards newly claimed in this batch:

* **Trapped in the Screen** ``{2}{W}`` Enchantment — Ward {2} + ETB
  exile target artifact/creature/enchantment an opponent controls
  until this enchantment leaves the battlefield. Claimed by name-
  keyed dispatch in ``enchantment_builder``, using the new ``ward``
  kwarg on ``make_enchantment`` plus the existing
  ``ExileOpponentsNonlandPermanentUntilLeaves`` ETB. The
  ``artifact, creature, or enchantment`` target widening is
  functionally equivalent to ``nonland permanent`` for the EoE/DSK
  pool — same simplification Banishing Light's ETB already uses.

* **Conductive Machete** ``{4}`` Artifact — Equipment — ETB-manifest-
  dread-then-attach + ``Equipped creature gets +2/+1`` + ``Equip
  {4}``. Claimed by extending the equipment_builder's literal-ETB-
  line table with the printed manifest-dread line, dispatched to
  the new ``ManifestDreadThenAttachSelf`` engine class.

* **Killer's Mask** ``{2}{B}`` Artifact — Equipment — same ETB shape
  as Conductive Machete + ``Equipped creature has menace`` + ``Equip
  {2}``. Reuses the same literal ETB line dispatch.

* **Cursed Windbreaker** ``{2}{U}`` Artifact — Equipment — same ETB
  shape as Conductive Machete + ``Equipped creature has flying`` +
  ``Equip {3}``. Reuses the same literal ETB line dispatch.

* **Split Up** ``{1}{W}{W}`` Sorcery — modal ``Choose one —`` with
  ``Destroy all tapped creatures.`` / ``Destroy all untapped
  creatures.`` modes. Claimed via two new sibling regexes in
  ``parser.effects`` against the existing ``DestroyAllCreatures``
  engine class, now extended with mutually-exclusive
  ``tapped_only`` / ``untapped_only`` filter flags. The bare
  ``destroy all creatures`` Wrath shape isn't a regex yet — no spell
  in the pool prints it without a tap-state qualifier.
