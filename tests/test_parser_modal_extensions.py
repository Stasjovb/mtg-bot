"""Extended modal-spell parser coverage.

This file covers the ``Choose one or both —`` modal-header extension
added to ``mtg_bot.cards.parser.spell_builder._parse_modal_choose_one``.
The base ``Choose one —`` shape is exercised in
``tests/test_parser_modal_spells.py``; this file adds:

  - ``Choose one or both —`` happy path (synthetic spell whose modes
    both parse via the unified grammar) — produces a
    ``ModalChooseOne`` with ``or_both=True`` so the engine prompts the
    agent's ``choose_modes`` (plural) hook.
  - ``Choose one or both —`` reject path (one mode fails to parse) —
    the whole spell stays unclaimed.
  - Direct exercise of ``_parse_modal_choose_one`` for the ``or_both``
    branch.
  - Per-mode reminder-text stripping continues to work for the
    ``or_both`` shape.
  - End-to-end tripwire on the EoE modal pool: every real EoE
    ``Choose one`` / ``Choose one or both`` spell either claims and
    matches static, or stays unclaimed. (No real EoE modal claims as
    of this batch — mode-grammar gaps prevent every one of them.
    Verified per-spell here so the next grammar expansion that flips
    a card to claimed can confirm static parity in one place.)
