"""Tests for batch-13 unified-effect-grammar additions:

* ``each opponent discards a card`` / ``each opponent discards N cards``
  → ``EachOpponentDiscards(count=N)``. Untargeted opponent-wide
  discard. Surfaces in Virus Beetle's ETB trigger.
* ``exile target creature or Spacecraft`` → ``ExileTargetCreature()``.
  Gravkill's printed surface — the static side intentionally fudges
  the Spacecraft tail because the engine doesn't yet have a
  Spacecraft-aware target kind; the parser mirrors that fudge in
  lockstep so static parity holds.
* ``destroy target artifact or tapped creature`` →
  ``DestroyTargetArtifactOrTappedCreature()``. Radiant Strike's
  destroy clause.
* ``tap target artifact or creature`` →
  ``TapTargetArtifactOrCreature()``. Mental Modulation's middle
  clause. No-op if the chosen target is already tapped at resolve.
* ``discard a card`` / ``you discard a card`` / ``discard N cards`` →
  ``DiscardSelf(amount=N)``. Surfaces inside compound
  ``draw a card, then discard a card`` (Mechan Navigator's
  becomes-tapped trigger) and any future card with a bare
  controller-discard clause.
* ``, then `` joiner extension to ``_parse_compound_effect``: any
  two or more primitives joined by ``, then `` (in addition to
  `` and ``) compose into a ``Sequence`` in printed left-to-right
  resolve order.

Each new effect is exercised three ways: directly via ``_parse_effect``
on the normalized phrase, via ``_parse_effect_phrase`` (creature-trigger
surface form), and via ``_parse_spell_effect_phrase`` (spell sentence
form, capitalized first letter and trailing period). Negative cases
verify the regex stays narrow.

Card-claim tests confirm the parser end-to-end-claims the three EoE
cards unlocked by this batch (Virus Beetle, Gravkill, Mechan
Navigator).
