"""Tests for batch-17 whole-spell exact-text dispatch additions plus
the self-shuffle printing-flag detector.

Batch 17 originally extended the ``_WHOLE_SPELL_EXACT_TEXT`` dispatcher
with three entries (Darkness, Nexus of Fate, Green Sun's Zenith) and
added a name-aware self-shuffle rider detector (``_detect_shuffle_self_flags``).

In bespoke-spells2, **Nexus of Fate** and **Green Sun's Zenith** were
further migrated OUT of ``_WHOLE_SPELL_EXACT_TEXT`` to the per-clause
grammar:
  - Nexus of Fate: the new ``_TAKE_EXTRA_TURN_AFTER_THIS_ONE`` recognizer
    in ``effects.py`` claims "Take an extra turn after this one." as
    ``TakeExtraTurnAfterThisOne()``; the Nexus self-shuffle rider
    (second oracle line) is dropped by ``_is_self_shuffle_clause``.
  - Green Sun's Zenith: the new ``_SEARCH_LIBRARY_GREEN_CREATURE_X_TO_BATTLEFIELD``
    recognizer claims the tutor sentence as
    ``SearchLibraryForGreenCreatureWithMVAtMostX()``; the GSZ self-shuffle
    rider (second sentence on the same line) is split off by
    ``_split_sentences`` and dropped by ``_is_self_shuffle_clause``.

Darkness remains in the whole-spell dispatcher (its
``PreventAllCombatDamageThisTurn`` primitive lives in the per-clause
grammar, not the whole-spell tier — Darkness is claimed there).

The dispatch tests for Nexus and GSZ are updated to assert that the
whole-spell tier falls through (returns ``None``) while the per-clause
grammar claims them correctly.
