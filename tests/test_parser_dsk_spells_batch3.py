"""Tests for the Duskmourn spells / enchantments / equipment / artifacts
batch-3 parser additions.

Each commit in this batch lands one card via a small additive change:
a literal-line entry on an existing builder, a name-keyed dispatch
factory on an existing builder, or a small flag widening on an existing
engine class. No new bespoke engine classes are introduced.

New engine fields on ``CardPrinting``:

* ``aura_yours_only`` — when True, the cast-time target picker for
  ``is_aura`` cards only offers permanents the caster controls.
  Mirrors the printed "Enchant creature you control" / "Enchant
  artifact you control" line. The flag is independent of
  ``aura_enchant_type`` (creature / artifact). Default False so
  existing plain "Enchant creature" Auras (Frantic Strength, Tractor
  Beam, ...) keep their previous behavior.

New flag on ``OwnerPutsTargetArtifactOrCreatureOnTopOrBottomOfLibrary``:

* ``nonland_permanent`` — when True, widens the legal-target pool from
  "artifact or creature" to "any nonland permanent" (Vanish from
  Sight's printed scope). Same engine class is reused with a flag
  rather than a sibling class because every line below the legal-
  target filter is identical.

Cards newly claimed in this batch:

* **Glimmerlight** ``{2}`` Artifact — Equipment — ETB-create-Glimmer-
  token (no attach) + ``Equipped creature gets +1/+1`` + ``Equip {1}``.
  Claimed by extending ``equipment_builder``'s literal-ETB-line table
  with the printed Glimmer line, dispatching to bare ``CreateToken``
  (NOT ``CreateTokenAndAttachSelf`` — the printed text never says
  "and attach").

* **Sheltered by Ghosts** ``{1}{W}`` Enchantment — Aura — ETB exile
  target nonland permanent an opponent controls (until the Aura
  leaves), +1/+0 + lifelink + ward {2}, and the printed "Enchant
  creature you control" controller restriction. Claimed by name-
  keyed dispatch in ``enchantment_builder``, using the new
  ``aura_yours_only`` flag plus the existing
  ``ExileOpponentsNonlandPermanentUntilLeaves`` ETB and the existing
  ``attached_grants_ward`` rider that Hardlight Containment also
  uses.

* **Vanish from Sight** ``{3}{U}`` Instant — ``Target nonland
  permanent's owner puts it on their choice of the top or bottom of
  their library. Surveil 1.`` Two-sentence body composed via the
  Sequence sentence-split path: the bounce-to-library piece rides the
  existing ``OwnerPutsTargetArtifactOrCreatureOnTopOrBottomOfLibrary``
  engine class with the new ``nonland_permanent`` flag, then the
  trailing ``Surveil 1`` rides the existing ``Surveil`` primitive.

* **Bear Trap** ``{1}`` Artifact — Flash + ``{3}, {T}, Sacrifice this
  artifact: It deals 3 damage to target creature.`` Claimed by
  widening the ``deals N damage to target creature`` regex with an
  optional ``it `` prefix, mirroring the ``(?:this creature )?``
  shape on ``_DEAL_DAMAGE_TARGET_OPPONENT`` / ``_DEAL_N_DAMAGE_EACH_*``.
  The activated normalizer lowercases the first letter but doesn't
  strip the source pronoun (unlike the creature-trigger normalizer);
  the regex prefix accepts the surface form as it lands.
