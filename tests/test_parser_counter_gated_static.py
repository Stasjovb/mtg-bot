"""Tests for the counter-gated anthem static-ability grammar.

The counter-gated anthem matches lines of the shape ``Each creature
you control with a +1/+1 counter on it has <keyword>.`` and produces
a ``StaticAbility`` with
``StaticScope.CREATURES_YOU_CONTROL_WITH_COUNTER``. The new EoE card
unlocked end-to-end by this grammar is **Drix Fatemaker**, whose
single static line is exactly this shape.

The grammar is intentionally narrow: only the singular subject
``Each creature you control`` (with the fixed ``with a +1/+1 counter
on it`` filter) and a single keyword grant are accepted. P/T grants
and the plural-anthem subject would require their own surface forms,
neither of which appears on any EoE card today.
