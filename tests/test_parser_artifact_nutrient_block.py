"""Parser claims Nutrient Block via graveyard-from-battlefield trigger.

Nutrient Block prints:

    Indestructible (Effects that say "destroy" don't destroy this
    artifact.)
    {2}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: You gain 3 life.
    When this artifact is put into a graveyard from the battlefield,
    draw a card.

The new grammar atom is the trigger phrase ``"this artifact is put
into a graveyard from the battlefield"``: the ``Event.DIES`` zone
change (graveyard from the battlefield, any permanent type), not
LEAVES_BATTLEFIELD (which also fires on exile / hand / library
moves). It was LEAVES_BATTLEFIELD until 2026-10-24, mirroring a
static-registry simplification ("slightly looser — also fires if
exiled").

Other lines (Indestructible keyword, ``{2}, {T}, Sacrifice this
artifact: You gain 3 life.`` activated ability) all already parse via
the unified clause grammar — only the graveyard-zone-change trigger
phrase was missing.
