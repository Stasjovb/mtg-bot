"""End-to-end claim tests for EoE Special Guests bonus-sheet cards.

The legacy ``special_guests_builder`` module hosted a name-keyed
exact-oracle-text dispatch that returned canonical printings for a
small set of Special Guests reprints. Every entry has been migrated
to the unified per-builder grammar, the dispatch table is gone, and
the module itself was retired. These tests keep the end-to-end claim
assertions so future refactors can't silently regress one of the
migrated reprints.
