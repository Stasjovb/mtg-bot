"""Parity tests: parser vs static registry for 7 EoS (Stellar Sights) lands.

Each test verifies that ``OracleParserCardSource`` produces a
``CardPrinting`` identical to the one in the static registry
(``STELLAR_SIGHTS_LANDS``).  Failure means the bespoke dispatch table in
``land_builder._BESPOKE_EOS_LANDS`` has drifted from the canonical
``make_utility_land`` call in ``stellar_sights.py``.

The seven lands covered here all require complex multi-ability shapes that
don't map onto any single generic grammar arm:

- Cathedral of War   — enters-tapped + exalted keyword
- Mutavault          — manland (all creature types, colorless)
- Blinkmoth Nexus    — manland + explicit tap-for-C + Blinkmoth pump
- Inkmoth Nexus      — manland with flying + infect
- Grove of the Burnwillows — dual mana ability (C or R/G with life rider)
- Swarmyard          — paid regenerate activation targeting typed creatures
- Contested War Zone — combat-damage trigger + attacking-pump activation
