"""Activated-ability cost-reduction rider parsing.

Adds the inline ``This ability costs {N} less to activate if
<condition>.`` rider to ``_parse_activated_ability_line``.

The first EoE printing is Starport Security's
``{3}{W}, {T}: Tap another target creature. This ability costs {2}
less to activate if you control a creature with a +1/+1 counter on
it.`` Two pieces had to land before the line claims:

  * ``tap another target creature`` effect — new primitive in the
    unified grammar that maps to ``TapAnotherTargetCreature``
    (creature-only legal pool, source-self exclusion via
    ``state.resolving_source``).
  * Inline cost-reduction rider — the trailing rider sentence is
    stripped from the activation line before the standard
    ``{cost}: <effect>.`` shape is matched, and the captured
    reduction amount + whitelisted condition phrase produce a
    ``CostReduction`` attached to the ability's ``cost_reductions``
    tuple.

Unknown condition phrase rejects the whole line so the wrapping card
stays unclaimed rather than silently dropping the gate.
