"""Inline ``Activate only as a sorcery.`` rider parsing.

EoE always glues the sorcery-speed rider to the same line as the
activation rather than putting it on its own line, e.g.::

    {3}: Put a +1/+1 counter on this creature. Activate only as a sorcery.

These tests exercise the inline-rider branch of
``_parse_activated_ability_line`` for the supported cost shapes
(pure mana, tap, tap+mana) and confirm the negative cases — malformed
rider, unsupported effect — still return ``None``.

The standalone-rider machinery (``_is_sorcery_rider_line``) is
unchanged and tested elsewhere; this file only covers the inline shape.
