"""Parser claims Memorial Vault via the unified activated-grammar
plus the formula-driven generic ``ExileTopXOfLibraryMayPlayThisTurn``.

Memorial Vault prints:

    {T}, Sacrifice another artifact: Exile the top X cards of your
    library, where X is one plus the mana value of the sacrificed
    artifact. You may play those cards this turn.

Cost atom ``{T}, Sacrifice another artifact`` parses through the
unified activated grammar. The body composes the new generic
``ExileTopXOfLibraryMayPlayThisTurn(amount=MVOfCostPaidObjectPlus
(constant=1))``: the ``MVOfCostPaidObjectPlus`` formula reads
``state.resolving_cost_paid_objects[0]`` (the artifact threaded onto
the StackItem by the cost-payment pipeline) and adds 1, giving the
"X is one plus the mana value of the sacrificed artifact" semantics.
