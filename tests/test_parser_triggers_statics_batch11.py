"""Batch-11 trigger phrases + static-condition phrasebook additions.

Two surfaces grow this batch — the type-qualified self-ETB / self-attack
trigger family on the trigger side and a forward-looking N=3 spell-cast
threshold on the static side.

Trigger phrases (5 new entries on the predicate path):

* ``this Spacecraft enters`` → ``(Event.ENTERS, IsSelf())``. 13 EoE
  printings carry this phrase verbatim (Atmospheric Greenhouse,
  Debris Field Crusher, Extinguisher Battleship, Fell Gravship, Larval
  Scoutlander, Pinnacle Kill-Ship, Rescue Skiff, Specimen Freighter,
  Susurian Dirgecraft, Uthros Scanship, Warmaker Gunship, Wedgelight
  Rammer, Wurmwall Sweeper). Every EoE Spacecraft is an
  artifact-by-default permanent that gains a creature side via the
  Station mechanic, so its oracle text doesn't currently flow through
  the creature-builder ``_parse_clause`` pipeline that reads this
  phrasebook — the addition is forward-looking grammar coverage in the
  same shape as batch-10's ``"it's your turn"`` static-condition entry.
* ``this artifact enters`` → ``(Event.ENTERS, IsSelf())``. Three EoE
  printings (Dubious Delicacy, Melded Moxite, Pinnacle Starcage). All
  non-creature artifacts.
* ``this enchantment enters`` → ``(Event.ENTERS, IsSelf())``. Three EoE
  printings (Banishing Light, Seam Rip, Weftwalking).
* ``this Aura enters`` → ``(Event.ENTERS, IsSelf())``. Three EoE
  printings (Hardlight Containment, Pain for All, Tractor Beam).
* ``this Spacecraft attacks`` → ``(Event.ATTACKS, IsSelf())``. Three
  EoE printings (Entropic Battlecruiser, Sledge-Class Seedship,
  Specimen Freighter).

Each entry maps to the same ``IsSelf()`` predicate as the pre-existing
``"this creature enters"`` / ``"this creature attacks"`` siblings —
the predicate's object-identity check is type-blind, so the type
qualifier in the printed text doesn't change the semantics. The
static-card registry already builds every Spacecraft / artifact / Aura
ETB-or-attack trigger via ``IsSelf()`` directly (see
``cards/eoe_spells.py``: Pinnacle Starcage, Tractor Beam, Larval
Scoutlander, Specimen Freighter, etc.) so parser/static-registry
parity holds out of the box for the day a creature-typed printing
ships a type-qualified phrase that does flow through the parser.

Static-ability conditions (1 new entry):

* ``you've cast three or more spells this turn`` →
  ``requires_spells_cast_this_turn=3``. Forward-looking N=3 variant of
  the existing Brightspear Zealot ``two or more`` phrase. Same engine
  gate field; the engine's
  ``StaticAbility.requires_spells_cast_this_turn`` accepts any
  non-negative integer threshold.

No newly-supported card claims its oracle text end-to-end this batch:
every EoE printing that carries one of the new trigger phrases is a
non-creature card type whose builder doesn't route through the
creature-builder ``_parse_clause`` pipeline, and the new static phrase
has no EoE printing today. The batch is grammar coverage only,
mirroring the structure of batch 10.
