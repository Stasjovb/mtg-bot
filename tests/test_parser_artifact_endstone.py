"""Parser claims The Endstone end-to-end via the unified clause grammar.

The Endstone is a Legendary Artifact whose oracle text is two trigger
lines:

    Whenever you play a land or cast a spell, draw a card.
    At the beginning of your end step, your life total becomes half
    your starting life total, rounded up.

Both lines now parse through the unified ``_parse_clause`` grammar:

  * The first is a composite trigger — two events (``play a land`` /
    ``cast a spell``) joined by ``or`` — claimed by the
    ``"you play a land or cast a spell"`` entry in
    ``_COMPOUND_PREDICATE_TRIGGER_PHRASES`` (one ``TriggeredAbility``
    per arm, mirroring the per-arm fan-out shape Cryogen Relic's
    compound enters-or-leaves trigger uses). The arms appear in
    printed-text order — PLAYS_LAND first, then IS_CAST. Predicate
    vocabulary stays primitive (one event per ability).
  * The second uses the existing ``"your end step"`` entry in
    ``_AT_BEGINNING_OF_PHRASES`` for the trigger header plus a new
    literal-phrase recognizer in ``effects.py`` for the body
    ``"your life total becomes half your starting life total, rounded
    up"`` mapping to the generic ``SetLifeToHalfStartingRoundedUp``
    engine class.

The Legendary supertype rides through ``make_artifact(legendary=True)``
the builder already wires off the parsed type-line.
