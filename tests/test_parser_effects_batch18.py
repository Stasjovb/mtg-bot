"""Tests for batch-18 effect-grammar additions covering creature
becomes-tapped and tapped-creatures-gated end-step trigger bodies.

Three new effect primitives land in this batch:

* ``untap another target permanent`` →
  ``UntapTargetOtherPermanent()``. Nanoform Sentinel's becomes-tapped
  trigger body (paired with the trailing once-per-turn rider at the
  trigger-line level).
* ``another target creature you control gets +X/+X until end of turn,
  where X is this creature's power`` →
  ``PumpTargetOtherCreatureByXOverXWhereXIsSourcePower()``. Hemosymbic
  Mite's becomes-tapped trigger body. The variable-X bonus is fixed to
  the source's effective power at resolve time — encoded entirely by
  the engine class.
* ``put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control other than this
  creature`` → ``PutPlusOneCounterOnEachCreatureYouControl(amount=1,
  exclude_source=True)``. Dawnstrike Vanguard's tapped-creatures-gated
  end-step trigger inner effect (the ``ConditionalOnTappedCreatures``
  wrapper sits at the trigger-line level, not inside the effect-phrase
  grammar).

Three creatures newly claim through these primitives:

* **Hemosymbic Mite** — single-line becomes-tapped pump-by-X.
* **Nanoform Sentinel** — single-line becomes-tapped untap with the
  trailing once-per-turn rider.
* **Dawnstrike Vanguard** — Lifelink keyword + tapped-creatures-gated
  end-step counter spread.

The shared parametrized parity test in ``tests/test_parser_parity.py``
enforces that each newly claimed ``CardPrinting`` matches the static
one verbatim, so this file focuses on the new effect-phrase grammar
in isolation plus claim assertions.
