"""Compound-effect parsing — multiple primitive effects joined by `` and ``.

Covers ``_parse_compound_effect`` (the new helper) and its integration
into ``_parse_effect``, plus end-to-end coverage through the per-context
wrappers (``_parse_effect_phrase`` for creature triggers and
``_parse_spell_effect_phrase`` for spells). Single-effect parsing
should remain unchanged for phrases with no `` and ``.
