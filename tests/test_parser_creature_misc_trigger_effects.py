"""Tests for batch-19 trigger-time and effect-grammar additions.

Three new pieces of grammar land in this batch:

* ``At the beginning of combat on your turn`` —
  ``_AT_BEGINNING_OF_PHRASES`` gains the
  ``"combat on your turn"`` entry mapping to
  ``(Event.BEGINNING_OF_COMBAT, Controlled(YOU))``. Mirrors the
  existing ``"your end step"`` precedent: ``your X`` reads as
  ``Controlled(YOU)`` (the trigger fires on the controller's own
  combat). ``each combat`` would map to ``Always()`` if a future
  printing ships it; no EoE printing today carries the variant.

* ``you may discard your hand. If you do, draw N cards`` →
  ``DiscardHandThenDrawN(amount=N)``. Vaultguard Trooper's tapped-
  creatures-gated end-step trigger inner effect. Distinct from the
  existing single-card ``you may discard a card. If you do, draw N
  cards`` shape (Mechan Navigator-adjacent grammar): discards the
  WHOLE hand, not a single chosen card.

* ``[this creature ]deals N damage to target opponent`` →
  ``DealDamageToTargetOpponent(amount=N)``. Biotech Specialist's
  sacrifice-an-artifact trigger body. Accepts both the bare
  ``deals N damage to target opponent`` form (post normal
  ``it``-strip) AND the explicit ``this creature deals …`` form
  Scryfall prints when the trigger condition's subject is ``you``
  (so ``it`` would be ambiguous).

Three creatures newly claim through these primitives:

* **Molecular Modifier** — ``At the beginning of combat on your
  turn, target creature you control gets +1/+0 and gains first
  strike until end of turn.`` The inner pump-and-grant effect
  already parsed via the existing ``_PUMP_AND_GAIN_KEYWORDS_UEOT``
  regex; the only blocker was the unrecognized
  ``combat on your turn`` time phrase.
* **Vaultguard Trooper** — ``At the beginning of your end step, if
  you control two or more tapped creatures, you may discard your
  hand. If you do, draw two cards.`` The
  ``ConditionalOnTappedCreatures`` wrapper already sat at the
  trigger-line level via the tapped-creatures-gate prefix path; the
  blocker was the unrecognized inner-effect grammar.
* **Biotech Specialist** — ETB create a Lander token, plus
  ``Whenever you sacrifice an artifact, this creature deals 2
  damage to target opponent.`` Both triggers parse through existing
  grammar except the new ``this creature deals …`` effect-phrase.

The shared parametrized parity test in ``tests/test_parser_parity.py``
enforces full ``CardPrinting`` parity, so this file focuses on the
new grammar in isolation plus claim assertions.
