"""Tests for the Duskmourn enchantments batch-1 parser additions.

Each commit in this batch lands one DSK enchantment via name-keyed
dispatch on the existing ``enchantment_builder`` table.

Cards newly claimed in this batch:

* **Shardmage's Rescue** ``{W}`` Enchantment — Aura. Flash +
  Enchant-creature-you-control + ``Enchanted creature gets +1/+1``.
  The conditional ``As long as this Aura entered this turn, enchanted
  creature has hexproof`` line is dropped as an honest no-op:
  hexproof is engine-unenforced metadata in this codebase (the
  rooms-batch6 Lecture Hall precedent), so a conditional grant is
  identically a no-op.

* **Cracked Skull** ``{2}{B}`` Enchantment — Aura. ETB look-at-target-
  opp-hand may-discard + DEALT_DAMAGE-destroys-enchanted. The new
  ``TargetOpponentLookHandMayDiscard`` engine class honours the
  printed ``You may`` gate via ``Agent.choose_yes_no`` rather than
  forcing the discard the way ``TargetOpponentDiscardsCasterChoice``
  does. ``target player`` is narrowed to ``target opponent`` per the
  standard EoE / DSK simplification — self-targeting is never
  strategically correct for the controller. The destroys-host
  trigger rides the same shape Cryoshatter's bottom trigger uses.

* **Sporogenic Infection** ``{1}{B}`` Enchantment — Aura. ETB target-
  opp-sacs-creature-other-than-enchanted + DEALT_DAMAGE-destroys-
  enchanted. The new
  ``TargetOpponentSacrificesCreatureOtherThanEnchanted`` engine
  class identifies the host via ``state.resolving_source.attached_to``
  and excludes it from the target's sac options. ``target player``
  narrows to ``target opponent`` per the same simplification Cracked
  Skull rides.

* **Leyline of Mutation** ``{2}{G}{G}`` Enchantment. Honest no-op
  claim — both printed lines (the opening-hand-replacement Leyline
  mechanic and the ``You may pay {W}{U}{B}{R}{G} rather than pay
  the mana cost`` alt cost) are inert in this engine today. Cost-
  and-name-only printing; same permission-not-offered shape Lecture
  Hall ships per dsk-rooms-batch6.

* **Stay Hidden, Stay Silent** ``{1}{U}`` Enchantment — Aura. ETB-
  tap-enchanted via the new ``TapEnchantedPermanent`` engine class
  + ``attached_prevents_untap=True`` static (Tractor Beam
  precedent). The ``{4}{U}{U}: Shuffle enchanted creature into its
  owner's library, then manifest dread. Activate only as a
  sorcery.`` activated ability is dropped as honest no-op — the
  activation is optional (controller's choice to pay), so not
  offering it through ``legal`` is the unoffered-alt-cost shape.
