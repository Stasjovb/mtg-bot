"""Tests for batch-16 whole-spell exact-text dispatch additions.

This batch extends the ``_WHOLE_SPELL_EXACT_TEXT`` dispatcher in
``parser.spell_builder`` with seven entries — the cluster of EoE
spells whose oracle text is a single sentence-block (or a tightly
bound two-/three-sentence block) that the static registry models
with one engine class. The per-clause grammar can't claim these
because at least one of their internal sentences (e.g. the
``Then if that creature's power is 0 or less, destroy it.`` rider
on Depressurize, or the ``If it has a +1/+1 counter on it, draw a
card.`` rider on Dual-Sun Technique) doesn't parse as a standalone
effect — and matching the per-sentence grammar to those forms
would yield primitives no other card uses.

Newly claimed spells:

* **Depressurize** ``{1}{B}`` Instant — target creature gets -3/-0
  UEOT plus a state-based death check. Maps to
  ``DepressurizeEffect(power_penalty=3)``.
* **Focus Fire** ``{W}`` Instant — variable-X burn whose X reads
  ``2 plus the number of creatures and/or Spacecraft you control``.
  Maps to ``FocusFireEffect(base=2)``.
* **Diplomatic Relations** ``{2}{G}`` Instant — pump-and-grant-
  vigilance on your creature plus a fight-shaped damage rider.
  Two-target spell. Maps to ``DiplomaticRelationsEffect()``.
* **Biosynthic Burst** ``{1}{G}`` Instant — counter + grant-three-
  keywords + untap on a creature you control. Maps to
  ``BiosynthicBurstEffect()``.
* **Zealous Display** ``{2}{W}`` Instant — anthem with an opp-turn-
  untap rider. Maps to
  ``PumpCreaturesYouControlUntilEOT(power_bonus=2,
  also_untap_if_not_your_turn=True)``.
* **Dual-Sun Technique** ``{1}{W}`` Instant — grant double strike
  + conditional draw rider. Maps to
  ``PumpTargetCreatureUntilEOT`` with
  ``draw_if_target_has_plus_one_counter=1``.
* **Invasive Maneuvers** ``{1}{R}`` Instant — bare burn with a
  Spacecraft-state boost. Maps to
  ``DealDamageToTargetCreatureSpacecraftBoosted(base=3, boosted=5)``.

Each spell is exercised by:
  - A claim test confirming the parser's ``claimed_names`` includes
    it.
  - A dispatch test confirming
    ``_try_whole_spell_exact_text`` returns the same engine-class
    instance the static side ships.
  - The shared parametrized parity test in
    ``tests/test_parser_parity.py`` enforces that the produced
    ``CardPrinting`` matches the static one (no separate per-card
    parity assert needed here).
