"""Tests for the Duskmourn spells / enchantments batch-7 parser additions.

Each commit in this batch lands one or more cards via a small additive
change to the parser's whole-spell exact-text dispatch table. No
existing engine classes are modified beyond additive flag widenings;
the parser's job here is to claim spells whose printed shapes don't
fit the per-clause grammar but DO admit a clean simplification onto an
existing primitive (parser-is-right precedent: Unravel / Divert
Disaster / Trial of Agony / Turn Inside Out).

Cards claimed in this batch:

* **Impossible Inferno** ``{4}{R}`` Instant — 6-damage burn plus a
  Delirium-gated impulse-draw rider. Whole-spell dispatch simplifies
  to bare ``DealDamageToTargetCreature(amount=6)``; the Delirium-
  gated impulse-draw rider is dropped because the spell-builder has
  no Delirium-gated conditional dispatcher today and the second
  clause doesn't parse as a standalone spell-effect phrase
  (parser-is-right precedent: Trial of Agony — keep the base burn,
  drop the unmodelable rider).

* **Violent Urge** ``{R}`` Instant — +1/+0 first-strike UEOT pump
  plus a Delirium-gated double-strike upgrade rider. Whole-spell
  dispatch simplifies to bare ``PumpTargetCreatureUntilEOT(
  power_bonus=1, granted_keywords=frozenset({"first strike"}))``;
  the Delirium-gated double-strike upgrade is dropped per the same
  parser-is-right precedent as Impossible Inferno.

* **Drag to the Roots** ``{2}{B}{G}`` Instant — Delirium-gated
  ``{2}``-cost-reduction rider plus a bare destroy-target-nonland-
  permanent body. Whole-spell dispatch simplifies to bare
  ``DestroyTargetNonlandPermanent()``; the cost-reduction is
  dropped because the cost-reduction parser doesn't recognize the
  ``Delirium — ... as long as ...`` shape and adding the
  ``four_or_more_card_types_in_graveyard`` engine condition would be
  a one-off for this card (parser-is-right precedent: Impossible
  Inferno).

* **Come Back Wrong** ``{2}{B}`` Sorcery — destroy target creature
  with a conditional reanimate-then-sac-next-end-step rider. Whole-
  spell dispatch simplifies to bare ``DestroyTargetCreature()``;
  the conditional reanimation + delayed end-step sacrifice rider
  is dropped because the engine has no "if put into graveyard this
  way, reanimate-and-schedule-end-step-sac" primitive
  (parser-is-right precedent: Trial of Agony).
