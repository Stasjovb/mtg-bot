"""Activated-ability mana abilities with a ``Spend this mana only
to <restriction>`` rider (Steelswarm Operator).

The unified effect grammar learned the multi-sentence
``Add {<mana>}. Spend this mana only to <restriction>`` shape this
batch. Restrictions wired today (one per Steelswarm Operator
ability):

  * ``cast an artifact spell`` → ``ActivationCost.spend_restriction =
    "artifact_spell"`` (gates cost-payment to artifact spells via
    ``_coin_satisfies_context`` in ``actions.py``).
  * ``activate abilities of artifact sources`` →
    ``"artifact_activation"`` (gates cost-payment to activated
    abilities of artifact-typed sources).

The two-coin same-color ``Add {U}{U}`` mana segment is also wired so
the second activation produces a tuple of two single-coin entries —
matching the static registry's
``produces=(("U", 1), ("U", 1))`` shape.

The activated-ability ``is_mana_ability`` flag fires for the
restricted variant too: ``_is_mana_ability_effect`` only checks the
effect class and target requirement, both of which still hold for an
``AddManaToPool`` carrying a ``spend_restriction`` (no targets, mints
mana into the controller's pool).
