"""Tests for the bespoke-spells1 migration batch.

This batch migrates five entries out of ``_WHOLE_SPELL_EXACT_TEXT`` in
``parser.spell_builder`` by introducing three grammar extensions:

1. **Delirium effect-rider dropper** — ``_is_delirium_drop_clause``
   recognizes ``Delirium — If there are four or more card types …,
   <effect>.`` lines and drops them from the clause stream before the
   per-clause grammar runs.  The base spell body then parses normally.
   Migrates: Impossible Inferno, Violent Urge.

2. **Delirium cost-reduction dropper** — same helper recognizes the
   ``Delirium — This spell costs {N} less to cast as long as …`` shape
   and drops it so no spurious ``CostReduction`` rule is attached.
   Migrates: Drag to the Roots.

3. **Delirium modal-header recognizer** — ``_parse_modal_choose_one``
   now accepts the ``Delirium — Choose one. If there are four or more
   card types …, choose one or more instead.`` header and treats it as
   a bare ``Choose one —`` header (the Delirium upgrade is dropped).
   Migrates: Let's Play a Game.

4. **Generalized ``SearchLibraryForCard`` recognizer** — three literal
   regexes (artifact, basic land, legendary creature) are replaced by
   one parameterized regex + dispatch table.  Also adds "Demon" to the
   dispatch table, enabling Demonic Counsel's base clause to be claimed
   by the per-clause grammar once the Delirium upgrade line is dropped.
   Migrates: Demonic Counsel.

Total migration: 5 entries removed from ``_WHOLE_SPELL_EXACT_TEXT``.
