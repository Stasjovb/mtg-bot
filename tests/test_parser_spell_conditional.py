"""Tests for the leading-spell-keyword-preamble branch in
``mtg_bot.cards.parser.spell_builder``.

The branch recognizes a leading clause that's just an unimplemented
spell-only keyword followed by its parenthesized reminder text (today
only ``Convoke (...)``) and drops it before parsing the rest of the
spell. This keeps the parser in parity with the static implementation,
which omits the keyword's behavior entirely. See the module docstring
on ``spell_builder.py`` for the rationale.

Coverage targets:
  - The new pattern recognizer accepts the supported keywords and
    rejects similarly-shaped lines that don't match.
  - End-to-end parse of Vote Out (the EoE spell now claimed by this
    branch) matches the static printing exactly.
  - Honor and Plasma Bolt — the previously-claimed multi-line spells
    that DON'T have a keyword preamble — still parse to their original
    combinator shapes (Sequence and ConditionalIfVoid respectively),
    so the new branch hasn't perturbed the existing dispatch.
  - A spell whose preamble looks similar but isn't a recognized
    keyword (e.g. a Kicker preamble) does NOT get its preamble
    dropped, falling through to the unsupported path.
