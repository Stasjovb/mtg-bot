"""Tests for ``scripts/parity_smoke.py`` — specifically the round-23
``--mode initial-state`` path that compares the Rust ``fingerprint()``
pymethod to a Python-side reimplementation of the hash recipe.

This is the first working parity check, narrowly scoped to the
fingerprint-vs-hash_state invariant. The pinned baselines below are the
same values asserted in ``tests_rust/test_fingerprint.py``; if either
drifts, the two test files should drift together (and the parity_smoke
script's documented contract — Rust fingerprint() byte-equal to the
Python hash recipe — is broken).
