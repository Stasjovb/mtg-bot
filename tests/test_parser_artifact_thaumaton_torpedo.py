"""Parser claims Thaumaton Torpedo via two new grammar atoms.

Thaumaton Torpedo prints:

    {6}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Destroy target nonland permanent.
    This ability costs {3} less to activate if you attacked with a
    Spacecraft this turn.

Two pieces had to land before the artifact builder claims it:

  * ``destroy target nonland permanent`` — new effect-grammar primitive
    mapping to the existing ``DestroyTargetNonlandPermanent`` engine
    class. Distinct from the existing
    ``destroy target noncreature permanent`` (creatures excluded) — the
    nonland form excludes only lands.
  * ``you attacked with a Spacecraft this turn`` — new condition phrase
    on the activated-ability cost-reduction rider whitelist, mapping to
    the engine key ``"attacked_with_spacecraft_this_turn"`` already
    wired in ``apply_cost_reductions`` and latched via
    ``Player.attacked_with_spacecraft_this_turn``.

Once both atoms exist the unified ``_parse_clause`` orchestrator
already glues the rest together — the activated-ability line carries
the inline rider, the rider's condition resolves to a ``CostReduction``,
and the resulting ``ActivatedAbility`` matches the static registry's
``make_artifact(...)`` exactly.
