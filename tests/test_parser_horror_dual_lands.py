"""Parser support for the Duskmourn horror-dual cycle.

Plain ``Land`` cards (no supertypes, no subtypes) whose oracle text is
the strict two-line shape:

    This land enters tapped unless a player has <N> or less life.
    {T}: Add {<C1>} or {<C2>}.

The condition is a deterministic state check at ETB (no agent
choice). The threshold flows through
``CardPrinting.enters_tapped_unless_any_player_life_at_most``;
``_play_land`` reads it after applying the default ``enters_tapped``.
