"""Tests for the Duskmourn artifacts / Equipment batch-1 parser
additions.

Each commit in this batch lands one card via a small additive change:
a literal-line entry on an existing builder, a name-keyed dispatch
factory on an existing builder, or a small flag widening on an
existing engine class. New bespoke effect classes are introduced in
``effects.bespoke`` only when no existing primitive captures the
printed body.

Cards newly claimed in this batch:

* **Saw** ``{2}`` Artifact - Equipment - ``Equipped creature gets
  +2/+0`` + ``Whenever equipped creature attacks, you may sacrifice a
  permanent other than that creature or this Equipment. If you do,
  draw a card.`` + ``Equip {2}``. Claimed by extending the
  equipment_builder's literal-trigger-line table with the printed
  attack-trigger line, dispatched to the new
  ``SawAttacksOptionalSacDrawEffect`` engine class. The bespoke
  effect encodes the (sacrifice-other-permanent, draw) combinator
  with the strict "permanent other than equipped creature or this
  Equipment" exclusion. ``IsHost(subject="attacker")`` matches the
  ``Whenever equipped creature attacks`` trigger condition (same
  predicate Atomic Microsizer's bespoke factory uses).
