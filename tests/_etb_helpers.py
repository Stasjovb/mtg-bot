"""Test helpers for the predicate-trigger migration.

Phase 2 migrated the ETB-event family (``"etb"``, ``"landfall"``,
``"artifact_enters_you_control"``, etc.) from string-key
``trigger=`` to the predicate-style ``event=Event.ENTERS,
predicate=...`` shape. Phase 4 extended the same migration to the
DIES / LEAVES_BATTLEFIELD families (``"dies"``,
``"leaves_battlefield"``,
``"creature_you_control_with_counter_dies"``,
``"nontoken_creature_you_control_with_counter_dies"``,
``"another_creature_you_control_dies_or_exiled"``,
``"your_creature_or_artifact_dies"``). Phase 5 migrated the ATTACKS
family — currently just the ``"attacks"`` self-attack key (the
aura/equipment ``"enchanted_creature_attacks"`` and
``"equipped_creature_attacks"`` relational variants stay on the
string-key path until a ``Host`` predicate lands). Phase 6 migrated
the turn-structure family (``"beginning_of_upkeep"``,
``"beginning_of_combat"``, ``"beginning_of_end_step"``, and the
``"beginning_of_each_end_step"`` variant) — these events carry a
Player subject (rather than a permanent), so the inferred-key
mapping pivots on whether the predicate is ``Controlled(YOU)`` (the
"your" variant) or ``Always()`` (the "each" variant — only present
for the end-step event today).

Existing tests that scan trigger-key strings
(``ab.trigger == "etb"``, ``"landfall" in {ab.trigger ...}``) need
to recognize either the legacy or the migrated shape, since some
abilities on a printing may be on the predicate path while others
are still on the string-key path (BLOCKS, deals_combat_damage, etc.).

These helpers paper over the difference for assertion code only —
production code never calls back into them. They are intentionally
narrow: they map a predicate-style ability back to the legacy
string key its (event, predicate) pair is structurally equivalent
to, and otherwise return the literal ``ability.trigger`` field.
