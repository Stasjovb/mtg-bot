"""Parser claims Dubious Delicacy via the up-to-one optional pump.

Dubious Delicacy prints:

    Flash
    When this artifact enters, up to one target creature gets -3/-3
    until end of turn.
    {2}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: You gain 3 life.
    {2}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Target opponent loses 3 life.

The new grammar atom is the ``up to one target creature gets ±N/±M
until end of turn`` regex. ``up to one`` flips the engine class's
``target_count_range`` to ``(0, 1)`` and ``requires_target`` to False
on ``PumpTargetCreatureUntilEOT(optional=True)``, so a no-target
resolution is a clean no-op rather than a fizzle (matters when the
battlefield has no creatures at trigger-time). The flash keyword,
typed-self ETB trigger phrase, and the two activated lines all
already parse via the unified clause grammar — only the optional
pump variant was missing.

The static registry's ``Dubious Delicacy`` entry currently drops the
printed Food subtype (``make_artifact`` doesn't expose subtypes), so
the parser-built printing matches by also producing a bare Artifact
type line — parity holds. This is a known static-side simplification
documented in eoe_creatures.py and is out of scope for this batch.
