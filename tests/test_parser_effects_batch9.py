"""Tests for batch-9 unified-effect-grammar additions: ``add {<color>}``
single-color mana, ``target opponent loses N life``, two graveyard-return
shapes for creature cards (to-hand and to-battlefield), the
artifact-card graveyard-return-to-hand, and the
``target creature gets +/-N/+/-M until end of turn`` pump.

Each effect is exercised three ways: directly via ``_parse_effect`` on
the normalized phrase, via ``_parse_effect_phrase`` (creature-trigger
surface form), and via ``_parse_spell_effect_phrase`` (spell sentence
form, capitalized first letter and trailing period). This three-way
coverage verifies a single grammar addition lights up both contexts.
