"""Tests for the creature-death-trigger cluster.

This batch ships two related additions:

* **Compound trigger condition** ``this creature enters or dies`` →
  a 2-tuple of ``TriggeredAbility`` (one per arm), one bound to
  ``Event.ENTERS`` and one to ``Event.DIES``. Both arms share the
  same predicate (``IsSelf()``) and the same parsed effect; the
  parser fans the single oracle line into per-arm abilities so the
  engine's per-event dispatch sees them as independent observers,
  matching the static-registry's two-entry layout for Thawbringer.
* **Effect primitive** ``put its counters on target creature you
  control`` → ``MoveSelfCountersToTargetCreatureYouControl()``.
  Surfaces on Dockworker Drone's dies trigger; the engine class
  reads ``state.resolving_source.plus_one_counters`` at resolve time
  and transfers them to the chosen target creature.

End-to-end card claim: Thawbringer's full oracle line (``When this
creature enters or dies, surveil 1.``) parses cleanly via the
compound-trigger arm, so the parser now claims the printing. The
static registry already modeled this card via two ``TriggeredAbility``
entries, so the per-card parity test in ``test_parser_parity.py``
also covers Thawbringer once the static is updated to carry its
printed subtypes.

Dockworker Drone stays unclaimed by this batch — its first oracle
line (``This creature enters with a +1/+1 counter on it.``) is a
static replacement effect whose grammar isn't in scope here. The
``put its counters on target creature you control`` effect ships
without an end-to-end card claim today; it unblocks Dockworker
Drone the day the enters-with-counter line gains a parser.
