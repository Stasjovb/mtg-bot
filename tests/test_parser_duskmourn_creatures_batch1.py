"""Tests for the first Duskmourn creature parser batch.

This batch grows the parser grammar to claim a cluster of unclaimed
Duskmourn (set code ``dsk``) creatures whose oracle text only needs
new effect-grammar / dispatch entries (no engine work):

* **``each player draws a card``** / **``each player draws N cards``**
  → ``EachPlayerDraws(amount=N)``. Friendly Teddy's
  ``When this creature dies, each player draws a card.`` is the
  Duskmourn surface form. The plural arm is forward-looking grammar
  coverage — no Duskmourn printing today uses N>1 but the engine
  class accepts any non-negative integer.

* **``draw that many cards``** → ``DrawCardsEqualToResolvingCombatDamage()``.
  Fear of Failed Tests's ``Whenever this creature deals combat damage
  to a player, draw that many cards.`` is the Duskmourn surface
  form. The engine class already exists (Starwinder uses it via the
  bespoke table); this is purely a parser-grammar addition.

* **``Treasure`` token printing** in ``cards/tokens.py`` —
  colorless artifact token with ``{T}, Sacrifice this token: Add
  one mana of any color.`` Piggy Bank's
  ``When this creature dies, create a Treasure token.`` lands via
  the existing bare-name token grammar once the registry entry
  exists.

The shared parametrized parity test in ``tests/test_parser_parity.py``
enforces full ``CardPrinting`` parity, so this file focuses on the
new grammar / dispatch entries in isolation plus the claim
assertions.
