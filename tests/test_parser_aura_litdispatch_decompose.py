"""Tests for the audit-litdispatch-auras decomposition that retired
the literal-trigger-line dispatch on Aura builders.

The parent audit flagged an 8-entry literal-trigger-line table on
``mtg_bot.cards.parser.enchantment_builder`` as "hidden bespoke
dispatch": each entry mapped a verbatim oracle trigger line to a
``TriggeredAbility`` rather than letting the unified
``_parse_triggered_ability_line`` grammar claim the line. Seven of
the eight entries were migrated to grammar-driven dispatch in the
initial pass (audit-litdispatch-auras). The eighth and final entry
— Chorale of the Void's attacks-trigger reanimate — was migrated in
audit-monoist-chorale: the body now claims through a literal multi-
sentence recognizer in ``effects._parse_effect`` mapping to the
generic ``ReanimateTargetCreatureCardFromDefendersGraveyard``
primitive, and the trigger header parses through the unified
grammar. The empty-shell dict was retired in
retire-empty-bespoke-shells.

This file asserts:

* every migrated trigger line still parses through the unified
  ``_parse_triggered_ability_line`` path to the same
  ``TriggeredAbility`` shape the literal table previously
  produced;
* Chorale of the Void's "Void —" end-step rider, which uses the
  "sacrifice unless" surface (not the standard intervening-if
  Void-gate surface), parses with ``requires_void=False`` because
  the void check rides the resolving effect class
  (``SacrificeSelfUnlessVoidActive``) rather than the trigger
  flag.
