"""Tests for parenthesized reminder-text stripping.

The parser drops parenthesized reminder text from each oracle line
before clause dispatch so the keyword/triggered/activated/static
grammars don't have to know about flavor parentheticals. The helper
``_strip_reminder_text`` lives in ``parser/text.py`` and is wired
into the creature and spell builders. The land builder intentionally
does NOT use it — basic-land reminder text (``"({T}: Add {W}.)"``)
IS the land's oracle text and must reach the basic-land grammar
intact.

Coverage targets here:

- The pure helper: bare keyword cleanup, multiple parenthetical
  clauses on one line, no-op for parenthesis-free lines, mana-cost
  braces left alone, basic-land-shaped input is touched (the land
  builder's protection comes from never calling the helper, not from
  the helper detecting the shape).
- Builder integration: creature with a reminder-text-bearing trigger,
  spell with a reminder-text-bearing tail, basic-land claim parity is
  unaffected.
- End-to-end: ``OracleParserCardSource`` newly claims Starfighter
  Pilot and Starbreach Whale once stripping is enabled.
