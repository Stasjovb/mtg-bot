"""Tests for the ETB-replacement-style ``This creature enters with …``
line shape.

Scryfall prints these as static replacement effects (CR 614), but the
engine doesn't model replacements today; the static-card convention
is to express them as a ``TriggeredAbility(event=ENTERS,
predicate=IsSelf(), effect=...)`` pair. The parser mirrors that
convention here — the line shape is recognized as a triggered-ability
source even though its surface text doesn't carry a
``When``/``Whenever`` keyword, and the produced ``TriggeredAbility``
matches the static entry shape verbatim.

Two body variants ship in this batch:

* ``a +1/+1 counter on it`` — Dockworker Drone's first oracle line.
  Maps to ``PutPlusOneCounterOnSelf(amount=1)``. The plural-N
  ``two/three/N +1/+1 counters on it`` shape is forward-looking
  grammar (no EoE creature prints N>1 today) but the regex covers it
  to keep the body-parser uniform.
* ``a +1/+1 counter on it for each other creature and/or artifact you
  control`` — Luxknight Breacher's printed body. Maps to
  ``PutPlusOneCountersOnSelfPerOtherCreatureOrArtifact()``, the same
  engine class the static registry already uses.

End-to-end card claims: Dockworker Drone (whose dies-trigger second
line was already parseable, blocked only on this batch's ETB-with-
counters first line) and Luxknight Breacher (single-line body).
