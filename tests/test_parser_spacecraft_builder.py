"""Parser support for Artifact - Spacecraft cards.

Spacecraft are Edge of Eternities-only artifact-type cards that gain
charge counters via the printed ``Station`` ability and animate into
artifact creatures with a printed ``power``/``toughness`` and a set
of stationed keywords once they pass the ``station_threshold``.

The first slice claimed here is the smallest end-to-end shape: a
single Station reminder line plus a single ``"<N>+ | <evergreen-
keyword-list>"`` tier line. Galvanizing Sawship is the only EoE
Spacecraft that fits this shape today; every other printing carries
either an ETB trigger, an attack trigger, a lower tier ability, or a
printed activated ability that lives outside this builder's grammar.
