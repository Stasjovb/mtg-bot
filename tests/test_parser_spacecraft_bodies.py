"""Parser support for Spacecraft body abilities — slice 2: a single
``"When this Spacecraft enters, <effect>."`` ETB trigger alongside the
Station + tier-keyword pair already claimed by slice 1.

Slice 1 (``test_parser_spacecraft_builder.py``) covers the bare
Station + tier-keyword shape and the negative cases for cards that
fall outside the body-less grammar. This file focuses on the new
ETB-trigger arm: the cards it newly claims (Wedgelight Rammer,
Wurmwall Sweeper) plus the negatives that keep adjacent body-ability
shapes — multiple triggers, attack triggers, non-trigger clauses —
out of scope for this slice.

Wedgelight Rammer's ``"create a 2/2 colorless Robot artifact creature
token"`` and Wurmwall Sweeper's ``"surveil 2"`` are both effects whose
phrase already resolves through ``_parse_effect_phrase``, so the
parser-built printing equals the static one byte-for-byte without any
new effect-grammar work — the only new code lives in the spacecraft
builder.
