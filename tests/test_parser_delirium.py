"""Tests for the Duskmourn ``Delirium`` mechanic in the parser.

Delirium is a static threshold MTG keyword: an ability fires (or an
effect resolves) only when the source's controller has four or more
distinct card types among cards in their graveyard. The parser
support lands as:

* ``Delirium`` predicate in ``mtg_bot.effects.predicates`` — a
  game-state check that walks the controller's graveyard and counts
  distinct card types from the comprehensive-rules taxonomy
  (Creature, Land, Sorcery, Instant, Enchantment, Artifact,
  Planeswalker, Battle, Tribal). Subject-independent, mirrors
  ``VoidActive`` and ``OpponentControlsMoreLandsThanYou``.

* ``_INTERVENING_IF_PHRASES`` entry: the canonical printed gate
  ``"there are four or more card types among cards in your graveyard"``
  maps to ``StateBound(Delirium())``. The Delirium ability-word prefix
  (``Delirium — ``) carries no rules consequence — it strips through
  the existing generic ``_strip_ability_word_prefix`` helper with no
  Delirium-specific code path needed for ``When``/``Whenever`` triggers.

* ``_DELIRIUM_PREFIX`` / ``_DELIRIUM_AT_BEGINNING_GATE_PREFIX`` in
  ``triggers.py`` (bespoke-delirium) — handles the distinct surface
  ``Delirium — At the beginning of <when>, if there are four or more
  card types among cards in your graveyard, <effect>.`` by stripping
  the prefix, consuming the gate clause, and AND-ing
  ``StateBound(Delirium())`` onto the trigger's base predicate (same
  predicate-compose pattern as ``Survival — At the beginning of``).
  The ``_strip_ability_word_prefix`` lookahead guards against
  ``Delirium — At …`` being parsed as a generic ability-word strip
  (it only strips in front of ``When``/``Whenever``), so the prefix is
  detected explicitly here mirroring the ``_VOID_PREFIX`` /
  ``_SURVIVAL_PREFIX`` precedent.
