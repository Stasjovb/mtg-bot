"""Tests for the trailing once-per-turn rider on triggered-ability lines.

Scryfall prints ``This ability triggers only once each turn.`` as a
second sentence glued to the trigger body with a single space
separator. The parser strips the suffix up front (in
``_parse_triggered_ability_line``) and sets ``once_per_turn=True`` on
the resulting ``TriggeredAbility``. The strip is rider-aware on both
the plain trigger path and the intervening-if path.

Mechan Assembler is the EoE printing that ships this rider on a
parser-claimed card today (its trigger phrase is already in
``_PREDICATE_TRIGGER_PHRASES`` and its effect parses via the
unified token-creation grammar). Nanoform Sentinel also carries the
rider but its effect (``untap another target permanent``) isn't yet
in the effect grammar, so it stays unclaimed.
