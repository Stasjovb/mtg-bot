"""Shared fixtures for Vintage Roto (``roto`` pool) card tests.

``roto_card(name)`` returns the raw record from the roto pool's files
(the Scryfall dump ``data/cube_roto.json`` or the hand-authored custom
cards ``data/cube_roto_custom.json``); ``printing(name)`` builds it
through the parser source's own claim path (``build_card_record``) and
asserts the card is claimed. Arena/agent helpers are re-exported from the cube
artifact helpers so roto tests read like the cube bucket tests.

Roto cards are part of the default ``all`` pool since 2026-10-03, so
the default card source holds them too; these helpers build one record
through the claim path without depending on the active source.
