"""Tests for the modal-spell ``Choose one —`` branch in
``mtg_bot.cards.parser.spell_builder``.

The branch recognizes Scryfall's printed shape of a modal spell:

  ``Choose one —``  (em-dash, U+2014)
  ``• <mode 1 sentence>``
  ``• <mode 2 sentence>``
  ``• <mode 3 sentence>``  (optional, more allowed)

When every mode parses via the unified spell-effect grammar, the
clauses combine into a ``ModalChooseOne`` effect. If any mode line
fails to parse, the whole spell is skipped (returns ``None``) — a
partial modal effect would silently change the spell's playable
behavior.

Coverage targets:
  - Synthetic modal spell with two recognized modes parses to a
    ``ModalChooseOne`` over the right ordered modes.
  - Synthetic three-mode modal spell parses correctly (parser must
    not be hard-coded to two modes).
  - Synthetic modal spell with at least one unrecognized mode
    returns ``None``.
  - The ``Choose one or both`` shape (Scour for Scrap) is recognized
    (extended in a follow-up batch) and produces a ``ModalChooseOne``
    with ``or_both=True`` so the engine routes mode-pick through
    the agent's ``choose_modes`` (plural) hook. See
    ``tests/test_parser_modal_extensions.py`` for happy-path coverage.
  - The ``Choose two`` shape is NOT claimed by this branch — out of
    scope this batch.
  - A header without bullet lines (or with only one mode) is rejected.
  - A bullet line without a leading header is NOT silently treated as
    a Sequence clause and parsed in isolation — the existing Sequence
    fallback would reject it because the bullet prefix isn't a
    recognized spell-effect surface.
  - The end-to-end EoE pool: every real EoE ``Choose one`` modal
    spell either parses to a ``ModalChooseOne`` matching the static
    printing, or stays unclaimed (the unified grammar doesn't yet
    cover its modes). Today every real EoE modal stays unclaimed;
    this test acts as a tripwire when a future grammar expansion
    starts claiming one of them.
