"""Tests for batch-9 trigger-condition phrase additions.

Five new condition phrases land in this batch — all on the predicate-
trigger path (the legacy string-key path is empty after phases 4-9):

* ``a creature you control dies`` →
  ``(Event.DIES, IsCreature() & Controlled(YOU))`` — Sothera, the
  Supervoid. Broader than the existing
  ``a creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it dies``
  (Meltstrider Eulogist) phrase: no counter qualifier.
* ``you sacrifice an artifact`` →
  ``(Event.IS_SACRIFICED, IsArtifact() & Controlled(YOU) & ~IsSelf())``
  — Biotech Specialist. Narrower type filter than the existing
  ``you sacrifice another creature or artifact`` (Lightless Evangel)
  phrase, plus the ``an``-vs-``another`` surface distinction collapsed
  onto the same ``~IsSelf()``-bearing predicate per the
  ``an artifact you control enters`` precedent.
* ``a creature you control deals combat damage to a player`` →
  ``(Event.DEALS_COMBAT_DAMAGE, IsCreature(subject="source") &
  Controlled(YOU, subject="source") & IsPlayer(subject="target"))`` —
  Starwinder. Broader than the existing ``this creature deals combat
  damage to a player`` (Illvoi Infiltrator) phrase: any creature you
  control, not just the source.
* ``a nontoken creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it dies``
  → ``(Event.DIES, IsCreature() & Controlled(YOU) & IsNontoken() &
  HasCounter("+1/+1"))`` — Rayblade Trooper. Stricter than the
  existing ``a creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it dies``
  variant: adds ``IsNontoken()`` so token deaths don't count.
* ``another creature or artifact you control enters`` →
  ``(Event.ENTERS, (IsCreature() | IsArtifact()) & Controlled(YOU)
  & ~IsSelf())`` — Weftstalker Ardent. Compound type qualifier;
  mirrors the static registry's Weftstalker predicate exactly.

Each phrase gets a ``_parse_trigger_phrase`` /
``_parse_predicate_trigger_phrase`` lookup test plus an end-to-end
``_parse_triggered_ability_line`` test that pairs the new condition
with an existing-grammar effect. No newly-supported card claims its
oracle text end-to-end this batch — every candidate has at least one
other unparseable line (effect grammar limitations like "this creature
deals 1 damage to each opponent", or non-creature card types like
Sothera's enchantment frame), so the batch ships predicate plumbing
without a parity-vs-static card claim test.
