"""Parser support for Spacecraft tier-gated triggered abilities and
tier-gated anthem statics — slices 4 and 5 of the Spacecraft builder.

Slice 1 (``test_parser_spacecraft_builder.py``) covers the bare
Station + single-tier-keyword shape and the negative cases for
malformed grammar. Slice 2/3 (``test_parser_spacecraft_bodies.py``)
adds standalone self-ETB and self-ATTACKS trigger lines. This file
focuses on the tier-gated dispatch arms:

- ``"<N>+ | When this Spacecraft enters, <effect>."`` and ``"<N>+ |
  Whenever this Spacecraft attacks, <effect>."`` tier lines whose
  body parses through ``_parse_clause`` to a self-ETB or self-ATTACKS
  trigger. The threshold ``N`` lands on
  ``TriggeredAbility.tier_threshold``.
- ``"<N>+ | <anthem-static>."`` tier lines whose body parses to an
  anthem-scope ``StaticAbility`` (``CREATURES_YOU_CONTROL`` /
  ``OTHER_CREATURES_YOU_CONTROL``). The threshold ``N`` lands on
  ``StaticAbility.tier_threshold``. Lumen-Class Frigate's
  ``2+ | Other creatures you control get +1/+1.`` is the EoE printing
  in this shape.

The companion **multi-tier static keyword** arm (multiple
``"<N>+ | <evergreen-keywords>"`` lines on one card) was considered
and intentionally NOT implemented in slice 4: the engine's
``StaticAbility.applies_to`` requires the target be a creature now,
and every real EoE printing's lower-tier keyword line falls below
the Station threshold (where the Spacecraft is still an artifact, not
a creature), so a self-scoped ``StaticAbility`` with ``tier_threshold``
would never fire. Modeling those grants correctly needs an engine-side
change to ``stationed_keywords`` and is left for a future slice. The
builder explicitly skips multi-tier-keyword cards (synthetic test
below pins that bail-out path) so the half-modeled shape can't slip
through. Slice 5's anthem-static arm doesn't run into this problem
because anthem scopes target *other* creatures and fire as soon as the
Spacecraft has enough charge counters regardless of whether it's
animated.

The multi-tier-trigger printings (Synthesizer Labship, Entropic
Battlecruiser, Dawnsire) all carry at least one body whose effect or
trigger phrase is outside the unified grammar. So every positive
synthetic-record claim in this file pins the new arm directly; the
real-card claims still come from slice 1/2/3, plus Lumen-Class
Frigate via slice 5.
