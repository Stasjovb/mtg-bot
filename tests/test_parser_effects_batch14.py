"""Tests for batch-14 unified-effect-grammar additions:

* ``this creature gets +N/+M until end of turn`` →
  ``PumpSelfUntilEOT(power_bonus=N, toughness_bonus=M)``. Surfaces on
  Skystinger's block trigger and the Landfall self-pump family
  (Icecave Crasher +1/+0, Remnant Elemental +2/+0).
* ``another target creature you control gains <kw>[ and <kw2>...]
  until end of turn`` →
  ``PumpTargetCreatureUntilEOT(power_bonus=0, toughness_bonus=0,
  granted_keywords=..., you_control_only=True, exclude_self=True)``.
  Pure keyword-grant variant (no P/T pump). Surfaces on Blooming
  Stinger's ETB.
* ``target player mills cards equal to your life total`` →
  ``MillTargetPlayer(use_controller_life=True)``. Space-Time
  Anomaly's printed form.
* ``target player mills N cards`` →
  ``MillTargetPlayer(amount=N)``. Forward-looking bare-amount mill
  (no EoE card prints this exact shape today).
* ``each player creates a <Name> token`` →
  ``CreateToken(token_printing=..., count=N, each_player=True)``.
  Surfaces on Edge Rover's dies trigger.

Each new effect is exercised three ways: directly via
``_parse_effect`` on the normalized phrase, via
``_parse_effect_phrase`` (creature-trigger surface form), and via
``_parse_spell_effect_phrase`` (spell sentence form, capitalized
first letter and trailing period). Negative cases verify the regex
stays narrow.

Card-claim tests confirm the parser end-to-end-claims the six EoE
cards unlocked by this batch: Skystinger, Icecave Crasher, Remnant
Elemental, Blooming Stinger, Edge Rover, Space-Time Anomaly. Three
of those (Icecave Crasher, Remnant Elemental, Edge Rover, Blooming
Stinger) also required matching static-side fixes — adding the
printed creature subtypes and, for Blooming Stinger, the
``exclude_self=True`` flag implied by the printed "another"
qualifier — so the parity gate stays green.
