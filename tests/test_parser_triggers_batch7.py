"""Tests for batch-7 trigger-condition phrase additions.

Three new condition phrases land in this batch:

* ``you cast your second spell each turn`` → engine key
  ``second_spell_each_turn`` (Illvoi Operative, Sunstar Lightsmith,
  Station Monitor, etc.).
* ``you sacrifice another creature or artifact`` → engine key
  ``sacrifice_creature_or_artifact`` (Lightless Evangel).
* ``a creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it dies`` →
  engine key ``creature_you_control_with_counter_dies``
  (Meltstrider Eulogist).

Each gets a ``_parse_trigger_phrase`` lookup test, an end-to-end
``_parse_triggered_ability_line`` test that pairs the new condition
with an existing-grammar effect, and a shared negative test for an
unknown phrase.
