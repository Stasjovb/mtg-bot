"""Tests for the bespoke-spells2 migration batch.

This batch migrates four entries out of ``_WHOLE_SPELL_EXACT_TEXT`` in
``parser.spell_builder`` by introducing five grammar extensions:

1. **Self-shuffle rider dropper** (``_is_self_shuffle_clause``) — recognizes
   the two printed self-shuffle surface forms and drops them from the
   effect-clause stream.  The behavior is already wired via the
   ``shuffles_into_library_instead_of_graveyard`` printing flag
   (``_detect_shuffle_self_flags``); dropping the clause lets the
   remaining effect clause parse cleanly through the unified grammar.

   Two shapes recognized:
     - ``Shuffle <Name> into its owner's library.`` (GSZ form)
     - ``If <Name> would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, reveal
       <Name> and shuffle it into its owner's library instead.``
       (Nexus of Fate form)

2. **``_TAKE_EXTRA_TURN_AFTER_THIS_ONE`` recognizer** (effects.py) — maps
   "take an extra turn after this one" to ``TakeExtraTurnAfterThisOne()``.
   Migrates: **Nexus of Fate** (main clause; Nexus rider dropped by #1).

3. **``_SEARCH_LIBRARY_GREEN_CREATURE_X_TO_BATTLEFIELD`` recognizer**
   (effects.py) — maps "search your library for a green creature card with
   mana value X or less, put it onto the battlefield, then shuffle" to
   ``SearchLibraryForGreenCreatureWithMVAtMostX()``.
   Migrates: **Green Sun's Zenith** (main clause; GSZ rider dropped by #1).

4. **``_SURVEIL_X_ARTIFACT_COUNT`` recognizer** (effects.py) — maps "surveil
   X, where X is the number of artifacts you control" to
   ``Surveil(amount=1, use_artifact_count=True)``.  Together with the
   existing ``_DRAW_N_CARDS`` recognizer (after ``_split_effect_sentences``
   strips the leading "Then "), the Sequence combinator produces the same
   ``Sequence(Surveil(...), DrawCards(3))`` the static side ships.
   Migrates: **Cerebral Download**.

5. **``_PUMP_LEADING_UEOT_KEYWORDS_BECOMES_TYPE`` recognizer** (effects.py) —
   maps "until end of turn, target creature gets +N/+M, gains <kw>, and
   becomes <type-change> in addition to its other types" to
   ``PumpTargetCreatureUntilEOT(power, toughness, granted_keywords)``,
   dropping the unimplemented type-change rider.
   Migrates: **Jump Scare**.

6. **``_DEPRESSURIZE`` recognizer** (effects.py) — a parameterized multi-
   sentence literal matching "target creature gets -N/-0 until end of turn.
   Then if that creature's power is 0 or less, destroy it" and returning
   ``DepressurizeEffect(power_penalty=N)``.
   Migrates: **Depressurize**.

Total migration: 5 entries removed from ``_WHOLE_SPELL_EXACT_TEXT``.
Table shrinks from 27 to 22.
