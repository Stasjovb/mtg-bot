"""Tests for the ``put a +1/+1 counter on this creature`` and
``destroy target creature`` effects in the unified effect grammar.

Each effect is exercised three ways: directly via ``_parse_effect`` on
the normalized phrase, via ``_parse_effect_phrase`` (creature-trigger
surface form with ``it`` prefix), and via ``_parse_spell_effect_phrase``
(spell sentence form, capitalized first letter and trailing period).
This three-way coverage verifies the unified path works for both
contexts after a single grammar addition.
