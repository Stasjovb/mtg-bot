"""Parser support for restricted-mana utility lands.

Plain ``Land`` cards (no supertypes, no subtypes) whose oracle text is
the strict two-line shape:

    {T}: Add {C}.
    {T}: Add <MANA>. <RESTRICTION-PHRASE>.

The first line is modeled as an explicit ``AddManaToPool`` mana
ability (the unrestricted base coin); the second line's restriction
phrase maps via ``_RESTRICTED_MANA_PHRASES`` to a
``spend_restriction`` tag the engine consults during cost-pay.

Currently claims Eldrazi Temple.
