"""Multi-piece (specifically 3-piece) activation-cost parsing.

The activated-ability cost grammar previously rejected any cost with
more than two comma-separated pieces. EoE prints many ``{cost}:
<effect>.`` lines whose cost is exactly three pieces, e.g.

  * ``{2}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact`` — Nutrient Block,
    Dubious Delicacy, All-Fates Scroll, Thaumaton Torpedo.
  * ``{1}, {T}, Sacrifice a Food`` — Ragost, Deft Gastronaut.
  * ``{2}, {T}, Sacrifice another artifact or land`` —
    Slagdrill Scrapper.
  * ``{1}{R}, {T}, Sacrifice a land`` — Kavaron, Memorial World
    (back face).

The parser now classifies each comma-separated piece into one of a
small set of atoms (mana / tap / sacrifice-self / pay-life / one of
the named-sacrifice flavors) and merges the bag of classified pieces
into a single ``ActivationCost``. The merge is order-insensitive and
rejects any bag with a duplicate kind, an unrecognized atom, or
4-or-more pieces (so 4-piece costs like Susur Secundi's
``{1}{B}, {T}, Pay 2 life, Sacrifice a creature`` still skip).

This file covers the new 3-piece behavior end-to-end. The
single- and two-piece paths still have their own dedicated test
files (``test_parser_activated_sacrifice.py``, ``test_parser_pay_life.py``,
``test_parser_mana_activations.py``) — only smoke-checked here when a
2-piece test exercises a code path that the 3-piece refactor changed.
