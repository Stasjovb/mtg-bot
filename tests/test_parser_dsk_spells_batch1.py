"""Tests for the Duskmourn spells / enchantments / artifacts /
equipment batch-1 parser additions.

This batch adds grammar primitives and dispatch entries that claim
several Duskmourn cards by composing existing engine classes — no
new engine fields or mechanics. Each new primitive is reusable across
contexts (spells AND creature triggered abilities) and across sets,
so the regex additions in ``parser.effects`` aren't DSK-specific even
though every card claimed by this batch ships in Duskmourn.

New effect-grammar primitives (``parser.effects``):

* ``deals N damage to each creature`` →
  ``DealNDamageToEachCreature(amount=N)``. Mass board-wipe burn
  surface, parallel to the existing ``deals N damage to each
  opponent`` primitive. Already-modeled engine class — exercised
  inside Lithobraking's reflexive optional-sac sequence and
  Extinguisher Battleship's ETB sequence in EoE — was missing only
  this surface form.

* ``target creature gains <kw>[ and <kw2>...] until end of turn`` →
  ``PumpTargetCreatureUntilEOT(granted_keywords=...)``. Pure-keyword-
  grant variant on a bare creature target with no P/T pump and no
  control restriction. Distinct from the existing
  ``another target creature you control gains …`` variant (Blooming
  Stinger) — that one carries the ``you control`` + ``another``
  qualifiers; this one is for phrases without any qualifier (Horrid
  Vigor's printed body).

New whole-spell exact-text dispatch entries
(``_WHOLE_SPELL_EXACT_TEXT`` in ``parser.spell_builder``):

* **Don't Make a Sound** ``{1}{U}`` Instant — ``Counter target spell
  unless its controller pays {2}. If they do, surveil 2.``. The
  static ships the bare ``CounterTargetSpell()`` because the engine
  doesn't yet model the pay-cost-or-counter Mana Leak shape. Mirrors
  Divert Disaster's parity simplification — the base mechanic, a
  counterspell, survives the rider drop.

New name-keyed enchantment dispatch entries
(``_ENCHANTMENT_BUILDERS`` in ``parser.enchantment_builder``):

* **Duskmourn's Domination** ``{4}{U}{U}`` Aura — gain control + lose
  all abilities + ``-3/-0`` continuous bonus on the enchanted
  creature. Composes existing ``make_aura`` flags
  (``attached_grants_control``, ``attached_grants_lose_all_abilities``,
  ``power_bonus=-3``); no new engine fields needed.

Cards newly claimed via the new primitive:

* **Pyroclasm** ``{1}{R}`` Sorcery — single-line ``Pyroclasm deals 2
  damage to each creature.``. Parses through the standard single-
  effect path now that the regex is in place.
* **Don't Make a Sound** ``{1}{U}`` Instant — claimed via the new
  whole-spell exact-text dispatch entry above.
* **Duskmourn's Domination** ``{4}{U}{U}`` Aura — claimed via the new
  name-keyed dispatch entry above.
* **Horrid Vigor** ``{1}{G}`` Instant — single-line ``Target creature
  gains deathtouch and indestructible until end of turn.``. Parses
  through the standard single-effect path now that the bare-target
  keyword-grant primitive is in place.
