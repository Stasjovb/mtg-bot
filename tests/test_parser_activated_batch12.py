"""Activation-cost atoms: ``Remove a +1/+1 counter from a creature you
control`` (batch-12 slice).

The bag-merge classifier in ``parser/activated.py`` learned a new cost
atom this batch — Sunstar Chaplain's
``{2}, Remove a +1/+1 counter from a creature you control: Tap target
artifact or creature.`` is the only EoE card that prints the literal
phrase, but the atom is wired through the full classifier so it
composes order-insensitively with mana / tap / sacrifice / pay-life.

Other unsupported cost atoms surveyed during this batch but explicitly
NOT added (no engine field on ``ActivationCost``):

  * ``Discard a card`` — no field. (No EoE card uses it as a cost.)
  * ``Exile an artifact card from your graveyard`` — no field.
    Single EoE example: Rust Harvester. The card's effect ("put a
    +1/+1 counter, then deal damage equal to its power") is also
    unsupported by the unified grammar today, so even a placeholder
    cost field wouldn't claim the card. Documented as out of scope.
  * ``Tap an untapped permanent you control`` (Gene Pollinator),
    ``Tap X untapped artifacts you control`` (Secluded Starforge),
    ``Exile this land`` (Plaza of Heroes) — no engine fields, all
    skipped per the "no engine support → document and skip" rule.

Sunstar Chaplain itself isn't yet end-to-end parser-claimed: its
triggered ability uses ``ConditionalOnTappedCreatures`` (no parser
support) and the activated effect ``Tap target artifact or creature``
isn't recognized by the unified ``_parse_effect``. So the static
registry retains the card; this batch only proves the cost atom is
wired correctly via direct ``_parse_activation_cost`` /
``_parse_activated_ability_line`` tests with effects the unified
grammar already knows.
