"""Parser claims Cryogen Relic via compound enters-or-leaves trigger.

Cryogen Relic prints:

    When this artifact enters or leaves the battlefield, draw a card.
    {1}{U}, Sacrifice this artifact: Put a stun counter on up to one
    target tapped creature.

Two pieces had to land before the artifact builder claims it:

  * Compound trigger phrase ``"this artifact enters or leaves the
    battlefield"`` decomposing into the two-arm tuple
    ``(ENTERS, IsSelf())`` + ``(LEAVES_BATTLEFIELD, IsSelf())``.
    Mirrors the existing Thawbringer (``enters or dies``) and
    Haliya/Syr Vondam (``enters or attacks``) compound entries.
  * ``put a stun counter on up to one target tapped creature`` —
    new effect-grammar primitive mapping to the existing
    ``PutStunCounterOnTappedCreature`` engine class. ``up to one``
    resolves as a no-op fizzle when no legal target is chosen.

Both atoms compose end-to-end through the unified clause grammar; the
artifact builder produces two separate ``TriggeredAbility`` entries
(one per arm) plus the activated ability — the same shape the static
registry produces.
