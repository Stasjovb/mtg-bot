"""Tests for batch-8 trigger-condition phrase additions.

Six new condition phrases land in this batch — five distinct engine
trigger keys, with ``artifact_enters_you_control`` reached from two
surface phrases that the engine collapses to one key:

* ``this creature becomes tapped`` → engine key ``becomes_tapped``
  (Starfighter Pilot, Nanoform Sentinel, etc.).
* ``this creature leaves the battlefield`` → engine key
  ``leaves_battlefield`` (Anticausal Vestige).
* ``this creature deals combat damage to a player`` → engine key
  ``combat_damage_to_player`` (Illvoi Infiltrator).
* ``this creature blocks a creature with flying`` → engine key
  ``blocks_creature_with_flying`` (Skystinger).
* ``an artifact you control enters`` and
  ``another artifact you control enters`` → engine key
  ``artifact_enters_you_control`` (Mm'menon Uthros Exile uses ``an``;
  Mechan Assembler and Oreplate Pangolin use ``another``).

Each phrase gets a ``_parse_trigger_phrase`` lookup test plus an
end-to-end ``_parse_triggered_ability_line`` test that pairs the new
condition with an existing-grammar effect. A shared negative test
keeps unknown phrases on the ``None`` path. ``Mm'menon, Uthros Exile``
is the one card whose entire oracle text becomes parseable end-to-end
with this batch (``Flying`` keyword line + the new
``artifact_enters_you_control`` trigger paired with the existing
``put a +1/+1 counter on target creature`` effect), so it gets a
parser-vs-static parity check too.
