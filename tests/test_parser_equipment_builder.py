"""Parser support for Artifact — Equipment cards.

The first equipment shape the parser claims is the simplest end-to-end
Edge of Eternities pattern: an ETB attach trigger, a single
``Equipped creature gets +N/+M [and has <keyword>]`` static line, and
an ``Equip {N}`` line. Meltstrider's Gear is the canonical example
this batch claims; Hylderblade is included as a "static + Equip with
no ETB" minimal happy-path; the other five EoE Equipment cards stay
out of scope (Void rider, Flash + UEOT keyword grants, custom attack
trigger, create-token-and-attach, granted-quoted-activated-ability).
