"""Tests for the Devour printing-level keyword recognizer.

Devour is the third printing-level parametric keyword (after Warp and
Ward) recognized in ``mtg_bot.cards.parser.printing_keywords``. The
EoE form is ``Devour land N`` (Famished Worldsire's
``Devour land 3``); the recognizer extracts the integer N and the
creature builder plumbs it through to ``make_creature`` as
``devour_land_multiplier=N``.

Riders / em-dash variants intentionally don't match — the enclosing
card falls through and is skipped, the same way Warp/Ward riders do.
