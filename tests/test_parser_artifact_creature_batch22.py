"""Parity tests for artifact-creature-batch22 bespoke dispatch additions.

Each test asserts that the oracle parser produces a ``CardPrinting``
for one of the 13 non-legendary Artifact Creatures originally in the
bespoke table.

Migrated OUT of ``_BESPOKE_ARTIFACT_CREATURES`` (claimed by grammar):
  - Pinnacle Emissary — warp cost ``{U/R}`` (hybrid mana support).
  - Tapestry Warden — vigilance + toughness-as-damage + toughness-as-station.
  - Virulent Silencer — predicate-dispatch poison trigger.
  - Gene Pollinator — ``{T}, Tap an untapped permanent you control`` cost
    atoms both classified; mana-ability grammar claims the effect.
    Migrated in bespoke-creature-wave7.
  - Rust Harvester — three-atom cost + ``, then it deals damage equal to
    its power to any target`` compound now parses after adding ``(?:it )?``
    to ``_DEAL_DAMAGE_EQUAL_TO_SOURCE_POWER_ANY_TARGET``.
    Migrated in bespoke-creature-wave7.
  - Selfcraft Mechan — new ``_OPTIONAL_SAC_ARTIFACT_WHEN_YOU_DO_EFFECT``
    recognizer in ``effects.py`` matches "you may sacrifice an artifact.
    When you do, <inner>" → ``OptionalSacArtifactForEffect(inner)``;
    ``OptionalSacArtifactForEffect`` updated to forward ``requires_target``
    / ``legal_targets`` / ``targets`` from the inner effect.
    Migrated in bespoke-artifact-misc.
  - Attack-in-the-Box — multi-sentence literal recognizer in
    ``effects._parse_effect`` decomposes the printed body into
    ``IfYouDo(MayDo(PumpSelfUntilEOT(power_bonus=4, toughness_bonus=0)),
    ScheduleSelfSacAtNextEndStep())``. The trigger header (ATTACKS +
    IsSelf) parses via the unified grammar. Migrated in
    audit-litdispatch-creatures.
  - Osseous Sticktwister — multi-sentence literal recognizer in
    ``effects._parse_effect`` dispatches the printed body to the
    generic ``EachOpponentSacsOrDiscardsOrTakesSourcePowerDamage``
    primitive; the trigger header (Delirium gate + end-step event +
    ``Controlled(YOU)`` predicate) parses via the unified
    ``_parse_at_the_beginning_of_line`` grammar with
    ``StateBound(Delirium())`` AND-ed on. ``Lifelink`` keyword parses
    via the standard keyword line. Migrated in
    audit-per-opponent-choice.
  - Wickerfolk Thresher — multi-sentence literal recognizer in
    ``effects._parse_effect`` dispatches the printed body to the
    canonical ``PeekTopMayBattlefieldIfLandElseHand`` primitive. The
    trigger header (Delirium gate + ATTACKS + IsSelf predicate) parses
    via the unified intervening-if grammar. Migrated in
    audit-litdispatch-creatures.

Migrated to grammar in engine-kavaron-elevator:
  - Kavaron Harrier — ``_CREATE_CREATURE_TOKEN`` extended with
    ``(?: that's tapped and attacking)?`` qualifier; literal multi-
    sentence recognizer in ``_parse_effect`` for the two-sentence
    "create ... that's tapped and attacking. Sacrifice that token at
    end of combat." phrase → ``CreateToken(attacking=True,
    schedule_end_of_combat_sacrifice=True)``. ``CreateToken`` gains
    ``attacking`` and ``schedule_end_of_combat_sacrifice`` fields that
    wire the engine behavior faithfully (tapped+attacking entry, pending
    end-of-combat sac schedule). The trigger fires via the unified
    ``_YOU_MAY_PAY_THEN_EFFECT`` grammar.

Migrated to grammar in bespoke-roving-actuator:
  - Roving Actuator — Void-gated ETB trigger parses via
    ``_TRIGGERED_ABILITY_INTERVENING_IF_LINE`` with ``VoidActive()``
    gate predicate; three-sentence effect body (exile-from-GY + copy +
    cast-free) claimed by a literal multi-sentence recognizer in
    ``_parse_effect`` → ``RovingActuatorETBEffect(max_mv=2)``.

Migrated to ``_BESPOKE_TRIGGER_LINES`` in bespoke-splitskin-monoist:
  - Splitskin Doll — initial migration was to ``_BESPOKE_TRIGGER_LINES``;
    fully decomposed in audit-litdispatch-easy via the parser's multi-
    sentence literal recognizer in ``effects._parse_effect`` returning a
    generic ``Sequence((DrawCards(amount=1), IfNot(
    ControlsAnotherCreatureWithPowerAtMost(2),
    DiscardSelf(amount=1))))``. No bespoke engine class remains.
  - Monoist Circuit-Feeder — ETB trigger line matched verbatim routes to
    ``MonoistCircuitFeederETBEffect``; ``Flying`` keyword and all other
    oracle lines parse via the unified grammar.

Migrated to grammar in bespoke-survey-mechan:
  - Survey Mechan — ``SurveyMechanActivationEffect`` bespoke class
    models the two-target activated ability body; literal recognizer in
    ``_parse_effect`` claims the exact two-sentence surface.
    ``_INLINE_X_COST_REDUCTION_RIDER_DIFFERENTLY_NAMED_LAND`` in
    ``activated.py`` maps the land-count cost reduction.

All EoE/DSK artifact creatures from this batch are now migrated.
Remaining bespoke cards (still in ``_BESPOKE_ARTIFACT_CREATURES``): none.
