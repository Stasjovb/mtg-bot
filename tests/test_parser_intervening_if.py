"""Tests for the intervening-if grammar in the trigger-line parser.

Adds support for the ``When/Whenever <condition>, if <gate>, <effect>.``
shape (CR 603.4). The middle ``if <gate>,`` clause looks up a closed
set of game-state gate phrases in ``_INTERVENING_IF_PHRASES`` and
AND-s the resulting ``Predicate`` onto the trigger's base event
predicate. Two gate phrases land in this batch:

* ``"an opponent controls more lands than you"`` — Sunstar
  Expansionist's ETB. Predicate ``StateBound(OpponentControlsMoreLandsThanYou())``.
* ``"a nonland permanent left the battlefield this turn or a spell
  was warped this turn"`` — the Void rider on Roving Actuator (ETB)
  and Alpharael, Stonechosen (attack). Predicate ``StateBound(VoidActive())``,
  which delegates to the engine's ``is_void_active`` helper so the
  trigger-time check matches the ``requires_void`` static-flag
  semantics already in place.

The parser handles BOTH a bare ``When/Whenever`` line and an
``<AbilityWord> — When/Whenever`` line: the generic ability-word
strip (``_strip_ability_word_prefix``) runs first, so a ``Void —``
prefix is removed before the intervening-if regex runs. We test both
shapes.

An unrecognized gate phrase causes the line to be rejected outright
— the parser does not silently fall back to the no-gate shape, which
would produce an over-firing trigger by dropping the gate. We test
that explicitly so a future maintainer doesn't loosen the rejection.

End-to-end card claims: none of Sunstar Expansionist / Roving
Actuator / Alpharael, Stonechosen are claimed by the parser today
(each has at least one other unparseable clause — landfall pump,
bespoke graveyard-copy, half-life damage). This batch ships the
intervening-if plumbing so those claims unblock as the surrounding
grammar grows.
