"""Tests for batch-20 creature additions covering the
multi-trigger / trigger+activated cluster.

This batch grows the parser by claims that pair a triggered ability
with a second card-level component — either an activated ability on
the same printing or a second trigger arm. Each addition lands an
isolated piece of grammar; the per-card parity gate in
``tests/test_parser_parity.py`` enforces full ``CardPrinting``
equivalence so this file only needs the grammar-level assertions
plus end-to-end claim checks.

New effect-grammar primitives:

* ``put target card from a graveyard on the bottom of its owner's
  library`` → ``PutCardFromGraveyardOnBottomOfLibrary()``. Chrome
  Companion's tap-mana activated ability. Surface form is post-
  normalization (the ``it `` prefix-strip in
  ``_normalize_creature_effect_phrase`` doesn't fire because the
  phrase starts with the verb ``put``); the ``its`` pronoun in the
  effect tail survives intact, mirroring the ``put its counters
  on …`` precedent.

Extended primitives:

* ``(?:this creature )?deals N damage to each opponent`` — the bare
  shape was already wired; this batch extends the regex with the
  optional ``this creature `` self-reference so trigger bodies that
  spell out the source explicitly parse. Used by Weftstalker
  Ardent's another-creature-or-artifact ETB trigger.

New printing-keyword grammar:

* ``Ward—Discard a card.`` / ``Ward—Discard a card at random.`` —
  em-dash discard-cost ward riders. Tagged return string from
  ``_parse_ward_discard_line`` (``"chosen"`` / ``"random"``) maps
  1:1 to the matching ``make_creature`` boolean kwarg
  (``ward_discard_chosen`` / ``ward_discard_random``). Unlocks
  Sunset Saboteur (chosen variant) — the random variant is
  forward-looking grammar coverage; the only EoE printing that
  carries it (Alpharael, Stonechosen) is unclaimable today for
  unrelated reasons (the Void-rider trigger-effect grammar isn't
  yet wired for half-life-loss).

New trigger-condition phrases:

* ``this creature or another creature or artifact you control dies``
  — Susurian Voidborn's two-arm-collapsed-to-one trigger condition.
  Distinct from the multi-arm ``_COMPOUND_PREDICATE_TRIGGER_PHRASES``
  (which produces one ``TriggeredAbility`` per arm) — this lookup
  produces a single ability whose predicate covers both arms,
  mirroring the static-registry layout for Susurian Voidborn. The
  inclusive wording (``this creature or another …``) means no
  ``~IsSelf()`` exclusion: the source's own death satisfies the
  predicate via the dispatcher's ``extra_observers=[dead]`` plumbing.

Newly-claimed creatures:

* **Chrome Companion** — ``Whenever this creature becomes tapped,
  you gain 1 life. {2}, {T}: Put target card from a graveyard on
  the bottom of its owner's library.`` The becomes-tapped + gain-1
  trigger half was already wired (BECOMES_TAPPED + IsSelf →
  GainLife); the activated half required the new graveyard-bottom
  primitive. Subtype ``Dog`` is added to the static registry per
  the parser-is-right rule (Scryfall prints the subtype).

* **Weftstalker Ardent** — ``Whenever another creature or artifact
  you control enters, this creature deals 1 damage to each
  opponent. Warp {R}.`` Trigger condition was already in the
  predicate phrasebook (batch 9); the extended ``this creature
  deals N damage to each opponent`` regex closes the last gap.
  Static drift fix: real card is 2/3 ``Drix Artificer`` (the
  registry was carrying the printed power/toughness reversed plus
  no subtypes — corrected per the parser-is-right rule).

* **Susurian Voidborn** — ``Whenever this creature or another
  creature or artifact you control dies, target opponent loses 1
  life and you gain 1 life. Warp {B}.`` Trigger condition lands via
  the new collapsed-arm phrasebook entry; the effect body splits
  through the unified compound-effect splitter into a
  ``Sequence(TargetOpponentLosesLife, GainLife)``. The static
  registry's bespoke ``TargetOpponentLosesNYouGainN`` engine class
  (still defined and still test-covered) is retired from the
  Susurian static in favor of the parser-produced ``Sequence`` —
  same gameplay outcome, no new effect class. Subtypes
  ``Vampire Soldier`` are added per the parser-is-right rule.

* **Sunset Saboteur** — ``Menace. Ward—Discard a card. Whenever
  this creature attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on target creature
  an opponent controls.`` All three lines were previously
  recognized except the em-dash ward-discard rider; the new
  ``_parse_ward_discard_line`` shape unblocks the printing.
  Subtypes ``Human Rogue`` are added per the parser-is-right rule.
