"""Parser claims Pinnacle Starcage end-to-end through the unified
clause grammar (ETB line) plus the multi-sentence literal-effect
recognizer for the activation body.

Pinnacle Starcage prints:

    When this artifact enters, exile all artifacts and creatures with
    mana value 2 or less until this artifact leaves the battlefield.
    {6}{W}{W}: Put each card exiled with this artifact into its
    owner's graveyard, then create a 2/2 colorless Robot artifact
    creature token for each card put into a graveyard this way.
    Sacrifice this artifact.

The ETB line claims through the unified clause grammar: the
``"this artifact enters"`` predicate-trigger phrase produces
``(ENTERS, IsSelf())`` and the ``_EXILE_ALL_MATCHING_UNTIL_LEAVES``
effect-phrase regex maps the body to the generic
``ExileAllMatchingUntilSourceLeaves`` engine class
(``match_artifact=True, match_creature=True, max_mv=2``).

The activation body decomposes through a multi-sentence literal-
effect recognizer in ``effects.py`` into a Sequence of three generic
primitives:

* ``MoveEachExiledWithSourceToOwnersGraveyard`` — recalls each card
  tagged with ``exiled_by_source == source.id`` to its owner's
  graveyard, recording the count on
  ``state.last_exile_recall_count``.
* ``CreateNTokensFromLastExileRecall(token_name="Robot")`` — reads
  that count and mints one 2/2 colorless Robot artifact creature
  token per card moved.
* ``SacrificeSelf`` — sacrifices the source as the printed body's
  last clause (NOT a cost atom — the activation's printed cost is
  just ``{6}{W}{W}``).

The bespoke ``PinnacleStarcageSacEffect`` engine class was deleted in
favor of these reusable primitives.
