"""Tests for batch-15 unified-effect-grammar additions:

* ``put N charge counters on target Spacecraft or Planet you control``
  → ``PutChargeCountersOnTargetSpacecraftOrPlanetYouControl(amount=N)``.
  Surfaces on Drill Too Deep mode 0 (the printing uses the spelled-out
  cardinal "five"). Amount accepts both digit and small-cardinal
  spellings.
* ``deals N damage to target tapped creature`` →
  ``DealDamageToTargetTappedCreature(amount=N)``. Surfaces on Reroute
  Systems mode 1; the engine class's ``legal_targets`` filters to
  creatures that are currently tapped.
* ``target artifact or creature gains <kw>[ and <kw2>...] until end of
  turn`` →
  ``PumpTargetArtifactOrCreatureUntilEOT(granted_keywords=...)``. Pure
  keyword grant on a permanent target whose legal pool spans both
  artifacts and creatures. Surfaces on Reroute Systems mode 0
  (indestructible).
* ``destroy target artifact, enchantment, or creature with flying`` →
  ``DestroyTargetArtifactEnchantmentOrFlyingCreature()``. Surfaces on
  Shattered Wings's destroy clause; the legal-targets filter spans
  artifacts (any), enchantments (any), and creatures with flying.
* ``target artifact or creature's owner puts it on their choice of the
  top or bottom of their library`` →
  ``OwnerPutsTargetArtifactOrCreatureOnTopOrBottomOfLibrary()``. Lost
  in Space's bounce-to-library clause; the chosen target's owner (not
  the spell's controller) decides top vs bottom at resolution.

Each new effect is exercised three ways: directly via
``_parse_effect`` on the normalized phrase, via
``_parse_effect_phrase`` (creature-trigger surface form), and via
``_parse_spell_effect_phrase`` (spell sentence form, capitalized
first letter and trailing period). Negative cases verify the regex
stays narrow.

Card-claim tests confirm the parser end-to-end-claims the four EoE
spells unlocked by this batch: Drill Too Deep, Reroute Systems,
Shattered Wings, Lost in Space. Each is a multi-clause spell whose
claim depends on both a new primitive and an existing combinator
(ModalChooseOne for the first two, Sequence for the latter two).
