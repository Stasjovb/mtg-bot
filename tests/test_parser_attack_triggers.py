"""Tests for the parser ATTACKS-event grammar additions.

The pre-existing parser already recognizes the ``"this creature
attacks"`` trigger phrase (phase-5 migration to the predicate-trigger
path). What's missing is the **effect** vocabulary that the EoE
attacks-trigger cluster prints. This batch lands one new effect
primitive plus a forward-looking compound trigger phrase:

* ``put a +1/+1 counter on target creature an opponent controls`` →
  ``PutPlusOneCounterOnOpponentsCreature(amount=1)``. Mirror image of
  the existing ``put a +1/+1 counter on target creature you control``
  restricted variant — legal targets are creatures NOT controlled by
  the resolving controller. Surfaces on Sunset Saboteur's attack
  trigger ("Whenever this creature attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on
  target creature an opponent controls."). Sunset Saboteur itself
  doesn't claim end-to-end yet because its Ward—Discard rider sits on
  a separate parser scope (``printing_keywords.py``); this primitive
  is the trigger-effect half of that pending claim.

* ``this creature enters or attacks`` →
  ``((Event.ENTERS, IsSelf()), (Event.ATTACKS, IsSelf()))`` compound
  predicate-trigger phrase. Mirrors the existing ``this creature
  enters or dies`` (Thawbringer) entry verbatim — same ``IsSelf()``
  predicate per arm, same per-arm fan-out at the static-registry
  level. Surfaces on Haliya, Ascendant Cadet and Syr Vondam, the
  Lucent (both print the named-self form ``"Whenever <name> enters
  or attacks"``); neither claims end-to-end yet because the parser
  doesn't substitute the printing's own name onto ``"this creature"``
  in trigger-condition phrases. This compound entry is the trigger-
  phrase half of those pending claims.
