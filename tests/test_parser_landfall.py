"""Tests for ability-word-prefixed triggered abilities.

Ability words (Landfall, Magecraft, Constellation, Domain, …) are
italicized labels with no rules consequence — the substance is the
``Whenever …`` clause that follows the em-dash. The parser strips
any ``<Capitalized Words> — `` prefix before parsing the body
through the normal triggered-ability grammar; we never enumerate
ability words individually. This file covers the stripping behavior
plus the Landfall trigger-key mapping that lets Eumidian
Terrabotanist claim end-to-end.
