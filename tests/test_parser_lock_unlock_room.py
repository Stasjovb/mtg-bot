"""``lock or unlock a door of target Room you control`` effect-grammar
recognizer.

Keys to the House's sorcery-speed activated body now claims through
the unified ``_parse_effect`` grammar instead of the artifact-builder
literal-line table. The recognizer maps directly to the existing
generic ``LockOrUnlockDoorOfTargetRoomYouControl`` engine class — no
new engine wiring; only the parser-side dispatch was bespoke before
this round.

The activated-ability cost atoms (``{3}, {T}, Sacrifice this
artifact``) and the inline ``Activate only as a sorcery.`` rider also
ride the existing unified activation grammar — the entire activation
line is now derivable from oracle text.
