"""Tests for additional ``As long as ...`` static-ability conditions.

The static-ability grammar maps a small phrasebook of "As long as
<condition>, this creature gets ..." surface forms to ``StaticAbility``
gate kwargs. This file covers the conditions added beyond the original
``you control an artifact`` entry:

* ``you've cast two or more spells this turn`` →
  ``requires_spells_cast_this_turn=2``

The corresponding engine gate is exercised by the static registry on
Mm'menon, Uthros Exile, but Mm'menon's printed oracle text uses a
different surface form (``~ gets +N/+N as long as ...``, with the
rider trailing) that the static-ability regex does not match. Adding
the leading-``As long as`` phrase to the phrasebook is forward-looking
grammar coverage — no EoE card unlocks today, but oracle text in this
shape will parse correctly.

The existing ``you control an artifact`` claims (Cloudsculpt
Technician, Gravblade Heavy) are pinned via the parser-source
end-to-end check to guard against regressions when the phrasebook is
extended.

Other candidate conditions:

* ``it's your turn`` → ``active_turn_only=True``. Added in batch 10.
  See ``test_parser_statics_batch10.py`` for the dedicated coverage.
* ``you have void`` — has no matching ``StaticAbility`` gate field
  (only ``TriggeredAbility.requires_void`` exists), so the parser
  must fall through.
* ``you control a/an <creature-type>`` — no matching engine field.
