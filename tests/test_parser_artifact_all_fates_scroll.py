"""Parser claims All-Fates Scroll entirely through the unified grammar.

All-Fates Scroll prints:

    {T}: Add one mana of any color.
    {7}, {T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Draw X cards, where X is the
    number of differently named lands you control.

Both activations claim through the unified ``_parse_clause`` /
``_parse_effect`` grammar — no literal-line dispatch:

  * ``add one mana of any color`` →
    ``AddManaToPool(produces=(("any", 1),))``. The activation
    layer auto-flags ``is_mana_ability=True`` because the produced
    effect is a non-targeting ``AddManaToPool`` (CR 605). Distinct
    from the bracketed ``add {<color>}`` shape: the latter mints a
    fixed-color coin known at parse time, this one defers the
    color choice to resolution.
  * ``draw X cards, where X is the number of differently named lands
    you control`` → ``DrawCardsByConditionMultiplier(condition=
    PerDifferentlyNamedLand(), description_fragment=…)``. A generic
    primitive whose resolve site reads ``condition.multiplier(state,
    controller_id)`` at fire time — re-uses the same condition the
    spell-side cost-reduction grammar wires for Fungal Colossus's
    ``This spell costs {X} less to cast, where X is the number of
    differently named lands you control.``
