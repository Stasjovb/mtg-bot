"""Tests for the ``At the beginning of <when>, <effect>.`` trigger
line shape — round-18 turn-structure trigger grammar.

The shape is distinct from the existing ``When``/``Whenever`` line in
that the leading word is ``At`` and the condition body is a fixed-
phrase time descriptor (``your end step``, ``each end step``, etc.)
rather than a free-form event clause. It maps to the turn-structure
events ``BEGINNING_OF_END_STEP`` (and forward-looking
``BEGINNING_OF_UPKEEP`` / ``BEGINNING_OF_COMBAT``) on the predicate-
trigger path.

This batch ships the bare base shape only (``At the beginning of
<when>, <effect>.``). Intervening-clause variants — the tapped-
creatures effect-wrapper and the trailing-if-gained-life rider — get
their own batches and tests.

Two time-condition phrases land here:

* ``your end step`` → ``(BEGINNING_OF_END_STEP, Controlled(YOU))``.
  Reads as "this is MY end step"; ``Controlled(YOU)`` matches a
  Player subject by ``player.id == source.controller_id``.
* ``each end step`` → ``(BEGINNING_OF_END_STEP, Always())``. Reads as
  "any player's end step" — fires on every player's end-step beat
  regardless of whose it is. Mirrors Ragost, Deft Gastronaut's static-
  registry shape (``predicate=Always()``).
