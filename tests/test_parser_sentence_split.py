"""Tests for the within-line sentence-boundary splitter in
``mtg_bot.cards.parser.spell_builder``.

Some EoE spells pack two effect sentences onto a single oracle-text
line separated by ``. `` rather than ``\\n`` (Radiant Strike's
``"Destroy target artifact or tapped creature. You gain 3 life."``,
Sami's Curiosity's ``"You gain 2 life. Create a Lander token."``).
``_split_sentences`` carves those lines at the
period-then-uppercase-letter boundary so each sentence flows through
the per-clause parser independently and the Sequence combinator
picks them up.

Coverage targets:

* The splitter helper alone — single-sentence round-trip,
  multi-sentence carve, ``If you do,`` continuation guard,
  whitespace and trailing-period edge cases.
* End-to-end builder — Radiant Strike and Sami's Curiosity now
  parse to the static-side ``Sequence`` shapes (newly claimed by
  this slice). Every other previously-claimed spell with a multi-
  sentence line — Vote Out's Convoke preamble, Plasma Bolt's Void
  rider, Scour for Scrap's modal modes, Dark Endurance's cost-
  reduction rider — still parses unchanged (regression guard).
* Synthetic single-line, multi-sentence spell that uses both a
  carve-eligible boundary AND an ``If you do,`` continuation in the
  same line — only the eligible boundary fires; the continuation
  stays welded to its parent sentence so the
  ``You may pay/sacrifice/discard {COST}. If you do, …`` family
  doesn't get torn in half.
* The full parametrized parity gate (``test_parser_parity.py``)
  picks up the two newly-claimed names automatically; this file
  doesn't duplicate that coverage but does spot-check that the
  parser-built printing for each new card equals the static one.
