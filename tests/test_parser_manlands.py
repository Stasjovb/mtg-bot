"""Parser support for Stellar Sights "simple" manlands.

The 6 EoE Stellar Sights manlands without bespoke per-animation
extensions share a fixed three-line oracle shape that maps cleanly
onto ``BecomeLandCreatureUEOT`` with a single keyword set. This
module verifies the parser claims those cards into the same shape
the static registry produces, and rejects near-miss variants
(extra abilities, X-cost activations, attacks-trigger riders, the
"It can't be blocked this turn." Tar Pit shape).
